        <documentation>40. 	This sub-process includes the initial investigation and identification of what statistics are needed and what is needed of the statistics. It may be triggered by a new information request, an environmental change such as a reduced budget. Action plans from evaluations of previous iterations of the process, or from other processes, might provide an input to this sub-process. It also includes consideration of practice amongst other (national and international) statistical organisations producing similar data, and in particular the methods used by those organisations. It may involve consideration of specific needs of different user communities, such as the disabled, or different ethnic groups.</documentation>

        <documentation>41. 	This sub-process focuses on consulting with the stakeholders and confirming in detail the needs for the statistics. A good understanding of user needs is required so that the statistical organisation knows not only what it is expected to deliver, but also when, how, and, perhaps most importantly, why. For second and subsequent iterations of this phase, the main focus will be on determining whether previously identified needs have changed. This detailed understanding of user needs is the critical part of this sub-process.</documentation>

        <documentation>42. 	This sub-process identifies the statistical outputs that are required to meet the user needs identified in sub-process 1.2 (Consult and confirm needs). It includes agreeing the suitability of the proposed outputs and their quality measures with users. Legal frameworks (e.g. relating to confidentiality), and available resources are likely to be constraints when establishing output objectives.</documentation>

At this stage the concepts identified may not align with existing statistical standards. This alignment, and the choice or definition of the statistical concepts and variables to be used, takes place in sub-process 2.2.</documentation>

        <documentation>44. 	This sub-process checks whether current data sources could meet user requirements, and the conditions under which they would be available, including any restrictions on their use. An assessment of possible alternatives would normally include research into potential administrative or other non-statistical data sources, to determine whether they would be suitable for use for statistical purposes. When existing sources have been assessed, a strategy for filling any remaining gaps in the data requirement is prepared. This sub-process also includes a more general assessment of the legal framework in which data would be collected and used, and may therefore identify proposals for changes to existing legislation or the introduction of a new legal framework.</documentation>

This sub-process documents the findings of the other sub-processes in this phase in the form of a business case to get approval to implement the new or modified statistical business process. Such a business case would need to conform to the requirements of the approval body, but would typically include elements such as:

•	A description of the &quot;As-Is&quot; business process (if it already exists), with information on how the current statistics are produced, highlighting any inefficiencies and issues to be addressed;
•	The proposed &quot;To-Be&quot; solution, detailing how the statistical business process will be developed to produce the new or revised statistics;
•	An assessment of costs and benefits, as well as any external constraints.

        <documentation>49. 	This sub-process contains the detailed design of the statistical outputs, products and services to be produced, including the related development work and preparation of the systems and tools used in the &quot;Disseminate&quot; phase. Disclosure control methods, as well as processes governing access to any confidential outputs are also designed here. Outputs should be designed to follow existing standards wherever possible, so inputs to this process may include metadata from similar or previous collections, international standards, and information about practices in other statistical organisations from sub-process 1.1 (Identify needs).</documentation>

        <documentation>50. 	This sub-process defines the statistical variables to be collected via the collection instrument, as well as any other variables that will be derived from them in sub-process 5.5 (Derive new variables and units), and any statistical classifications that will be used. It is expected that existing national and international standards will be followed wherever possible. This sub-process may need to run in parallel with sub-process 2.3 (Design collection), as the definition of the variables to be collected, and the choice of collection instrument may be inter-dependent to some degree. Preparation of metadata descriptions of collected and derived variables and classifications is a necessary precondition for subsequent phases.</documentation>

        <documentation>51. 	This sub-process determines the most appropriate collection method(s) and instrument(s). The actual activities in this sub-process will vary according to the type of collection instruments required, which can include computer assisted interviewing, paper questionnaires, administrative data interfaces and data integration techniques. This sub-process includes the design of collection instruments, questions and response templates (in conjunction with the variables and statistical classifications designed in sub-process 2.2 (Design variable descriptions)). It also includes the design of any formal agreements relating to data supply, such as memoranda of understanding, and confirmation of the legal basis for the data collection. This sub-process is enabled by tools such as question libraries (to facilitate the reuse of questions and related attributes), questionnaire tools (to enable the quick and easy compilation of questions into formats suitable for cognitive testing) and agreement templates (to help standardise terms and conditions). This sub-process also includes the design of process-specific provider management systems.</documentation>

        <documentation>52. 	This sub-process only applies to processes which involve data collection based on sampling, such as through statistical surveys. It identifies and specifies the population of interest, defines a sampling frame (and, where necessary, the register from which it is derived), and determines the most appropriate sampling criteria and methodology (which could include complete enumeration). Common sources for a sampling frame are administrative and statistical registers, censuses and information from other sample surveys. This sub-process describes how these sources can be combined if needed. Analysis of whether the frame covers the target population should be performed. A sampling plan should be made: The actual sample is created in sub-process 4.1 (Create frame and select sample), using the methodology, specified in this sub-process.</documentation>

        <documentation>53. 	This sub-process designs the statistical processing methodology to be applied during the &quot;Process&quot; and &quot;Analyse&quot; phases. This can include specification of routines for coding, editing, imputing, estimating, integrating, validating and finalizing data sets.</documentation>

        <documentation>54.	This sub-process determines the workflow from data collection to dissemination, taking an overview of all the processes required within the whole statistical production process, and ensuring that they fit together efficiently with no gaps or redundancies. Various systems and databases are needed throughout the process. A general principle is to reuse processes and technology across many statistical business processes, so existing production solutions (e.g. services, systems and databases) should be examined first, to determine whether they are fit for purpose for this specific process, then, if any gaps are identified, new solutions should be designed. This sub-process also considers how staff will interact with systems, and who will be responsible for what and when.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="3.1 Build collection instrument" id="17b66f68-fd76-4681-9ccf-54d6d4c19df9">
        <documentation>58. 	This sub-process describes the activities to build the collection instruments to be used during the &quot;Collect&quot; phase. The collection instrument is generated or built based on the design specifications created during the &quot;Design&quot; phase. A collection may use one or more modes to receive the data, e.g. personal or telephone interviews; paper, electronic or web questionnaires; SDMX hubs. Collection instruments may also be data extraction routines used to gather data from existing statistical or administrative data sets. This sub-process also includes preparing and testing the contents and functioning of that instrument (e.g. testing the questions in a questionnaire). It is recommended to consider the direct connection of collection instruments to the statistical metadata system, so that metadata can be more easily captured in the collection phase. Connection of metadata and data at the point of capture can save work in later phases. Capturing the metrics of data collection (paradata) is also an important consideration in this sub-process.</documentation>

        <documentation>59.	This sub-process describes the activities to build new and enhance existing components and services needed for the “Process” and “Analyse” phases, as designed in the &quot;Design&quot; phase. Services may include dashboard functions and features, information services, transformation functions, workflow frameworks, provider and metadata management services.</documentation>

        <documentation>60.	This sub-process describes the activities to build new and enhance existing components and services needed for the dissemination of statistical products as designed in sub-process 2.1 (Design outputs). All types of dissemination components and services are included, from those that are used to produce traditional paper publications to those that provide web services, open data outputs, or access to micro-data.</documentation>

        <documentation>61. 	This sub-process configures the workflow, systems and transformations used within the statistical business processes, from data collection through to dissemination. It ensures that the workflow specified in sub-process 2.6 (Design production systems and workflow) works in practice.</documentation>

        <documentation>62. 	This sub-process is concerned with the testing of assembled and configured services and related workflows. It includes technical testing and sign-off of new programmes and routines, as well as confirmation that existing routines from other statistical business processes are suitable for use in this case. Whilst part of this activity concerning the testing of individual components and services could logically be linked with sub-process 3.2 (Build or enhance process components), this sub-process also includes testing of interactions between assembled and configured services, and ensuring that the production solution works as a coherent set processes, information and services.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="3.6 Test statistical business process" id="89917ad5-8bd9-407e-9fc9-7cee576d9e61">
        <documentation>63. 	This sub-process describes the activities to manage a field test or pilot of the statistical business process. Typically it includes a small-scale data collection, to test collection instruments, followed by processing and analysis of the collected data, to ensure the statistical business process performs as expected. Following the pilot, it may be necessary to go back to a previous step and make adjustments to instruments, systems or components. For a major statistical business process, e.g. a population census, there may be several iterations until the process is working satisfactorily.</documentation>

        <documentation>64. 	This sub-process includes the activities to put the assembled and configured processes and services, including modified and newly-created services into production ready for use by business areas. The activities include:

•	producing documentation about the process components, including technical documentation and user manuals
•	training the business users on how to operate the process
•	moving the process components into the production environment, and ensuring they work as expected in that environment (this activity may also be part of sub-process 3.5 (Test production system)).

        <documentation>67. 	This sub-process establishes the frame and selects the sample for this iteration of the collection, as specified in sub-process 2.4 (Design frame and sample). It also includes the coordination of samples between instances of the same statistical business process (for example to manage overlap or rotation), and between different processes using a common frame or register (for example to manage overlap or to spread response burden). Quality assurance and approval of the frame and the selected sample are also undertaken in this sub-process, though maintenance of underlying registers, from which frames for several statistical business processes are drawn, is treated as a separate business process. The sampling aspect of this sub-process is not usually relevant for processes based entirely on the use of pre-existing sources (e.g. administrative sources) as such processes generally create frames from the available data and then follow a census approach.</documentation>

        <documentation>68. 	This sub-process ensures that the people, processes and technology are ready to collect data and metadata, in all modes as designed. It takes place over a period of time, as it includes the strategy, planning and training activities in preparation for the specific instance of the statistical business process. Where the process is repeated regularly, some (or all) of these activities may not be explicitly required for each iteration. For one-off and new processes, these activities can be lengthy. This sub-process includes:

•	preparing a collection strategy;
•	training collection staff;
•	ensuring collection resources are available e.g. laptops;
•	agreeing terms with any intermediate collection bodies, e.g. sub-contractors for computer assisted telephone interviewing
•	configuring collection systems to request and receive the data;
•	ensuring the security of data to be collected;
•	preparing collection instruments (e.g. printing questionnaires, pre-filling them with existing data, loading questionnaires and data onto interviewers' computers etc.).

69. 	For non-survey sources, this sub-process will include ensuring that the necessary processes, systems and confidentiality procedures are in place, to receive or extract the necessary information from the source.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="4.3 Run collection" id="e74b2f2c-ea09-4f01-bfe4-e70edfffa5cd">
        <documentation>70. 	This sub-process is where the collection is implemented, with the different instruments being used to collect or gather the information, which may include raw micro-data or aggregates produced at the source, as well as any associated metadata. It includes the initial contact with providers and any subsequent follow-up or reminder actions. It may include manual data entry at the point of contact, or fieldwork management, depending on the source and collection mode. It records when and how providers were contacted, and whether they have responded. This sub-process also includes the management of the providers involved in the current collection, ensuring that the relationship between the statistical organisation and data providers remains positive, and recording and responding to comments, queries and complaints. For administrative and other non-statistical sources, this process is brief: the provider is either contacted to send the information, or sends it as scheduled. When the collection meets its targets, it is closed and a report on the collection is produced. Some basic validation of the structure and integrity of the information received may take place within this sub-process, e.g. checking that files are in the right format and contain the expected fields. All validation of the content takes place in the Process phase.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="4.4 Finalise collection" id="9f9c957f-cade-44ce-acb7-25975890bee5">
        <documentation>71. 	This sub-process includes loading the collected data and metadata into a suitable electronic environment for further processing. It may include manual or automatic data take-on, for example using clerical staff or optical character recognition tools to extract information from paper questionnaires, or converting the formats of files received from other organisations. It may also include analysis of the process metadata (paradata) associated with collection to ensure the collection activities have met requirements. In cases where there is a physical collection instrument, such as a paper questionnaire, which is not needed for further processing, this sub-process manages the archiving of that material.</documentation>

        <documentation>79. 	Where data are considered incorrect, missing or unreliable, new values may be inserted in this sub-process. The terms editing and imputation cover a variety of methods to do this, often using a rule-based approach. Specific steps typically include:

•	the determination of whether to add or change data;
•	the selection of the method to be used;
•	adding / changing data values;
•	writing the new data values back to the data set, and flagging them as changed;
•	the production of metadata on the editing and imputation process.

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="5.1 Integrate data" id="89439b05-3986-47cb-bb73-bce6d12084a5">
        <documentation>75. 	This sub-process integrates data from one or more sources. It is where the results of sub-processes in the &quot;Collect&quot; phase are combined. The input data can be from a mixture of external or internal data sources, and a variety of collection modes, including extracts of administrative data. The result is a set of linked data. Data integration can include:

•	combining data from multiple sources, as part of the creation of integrated statistics such as national accounts
•	matching / record linkage routines, with the aim of linking micro or macro data from different sources
•	prioritising, when two or more sources contain data for the same variable, with potentially different values

76. 	Data integration may take place at any point in this phase, before or after any of the other sub-processes. There may also be several instances of data integration in any statistical business process. Following integration, depending on data protection requirements, data may be anonymised, that is stripped of identifiers such as name and address, to help to protect confidentiality.

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="5.3 Review and validate" id="d87961da-8abf-4d96-bb45-229e7d81d78c">
        <documentation>78. 	This sub-process examines data to try to identify potential problems, errors and discrepancies such as outliers, item non-response and miscoding. It can also be referred to as input data validation. It may be run iteratively, validating data against predefined edit rules, usually in a set order. It may flag data for automatic or manual inspection or editing. Reviewing and validating can apply to data from any type of source, before and after integration. Whilst validation is treated as part of the “Process” phase, in practice, some elements of validation may occur alongside collection activities, particularly for modes such as web collection. Whilst this sub-process is concerned with detection of actual or potential errors, any correction activities that actually change the data are done in sub-process 5.4.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="5.5 Derive new variables and units" id="53c481e7-e76e-4ccd-a806-e2ae3b9bb35b">
        <documentation>80. 	This sub-process derives data for variables and units that are not explicitly provided in the collection, but are needed to deliver the required outputs. It derives new variables by applying arithmetic formulae to one or more of the variables that are already present in the dataset, or applying different model assumptions. This activity may need to be iterative, as some derived variables may themselves be based on other derived variables. It is therefore important to ensure that variables are derived in the correct order. New units may be derived by aggregating or splitting data for collection units, or by various other estimation methods. Examples include deriving households where the collection units are persons, or enterprises where the collection units are legal units.</documentation>

        <documentation>81. 	This sub process creates weights for unit data records according to the methodology created in sub-process 2.5 (Design processing and analysis). In the case of sample surveys, weights can be used to &quot;gross-up&quot; results to make them representative of the target population, or to adjust for non-response in total enumerations. In other situations, variables may need weighting for normalisation purposes.</documentation>

It includes summing data for records sharing certain characteristics, determining measures of average and dispersion, and applying weights from sub-process 5.6 to derive appropriate totals. In the case of sample surveys, sampling errors may also be calculated in this sub-process, and associated to the relevant aggregates.</documentation>

This sub-process brings together the results of the other sub-processes in this phase and results in a data file (usually of macro-data), which is used as the input to the &quot;Analyse&quot; phase. Sometimes this may be an intermediate rather than a final file, particularly for business processes where there are strong time pressures, and a requirement to produce both preliminary and final estimates.</documentation>

        <documentation>87. 	This sub-process is where statisticians validate the quality of the outputs produced, in accordance with a general quality framework and with expectations. This sub-process also includes activities involved with the gathering of intelligence, with the cumulative effect of building up a body of knowledge about a specific statistical domain. This knowledge is then applied to the current collection, in the current environment, to identify any divergence from expectations and to allow informed analyses. Validation activities can include:

•	checking that the population coverage and response rates are as required;
•	comparing the statistics with previous cycles (if applicable);
•	checking that the associated metadata and paradata (process metadata) are present and in line with expectations
•	confronting the statistics against other relevant data (both internal and external);
•	investigating inconsistencies in the statistics;
•	performing macro editing;
•	validating the statistics against expectations and domain intelligence.

        <documentation>84. 	In this phase, statistical outputs are produced, examined in detail and made ready for dissemination. It includes preparing statistical content (including commentary, technical notes, etc.), and ensuring outputs are “fit for purpose” prior to dissemination to customers. This phase also includes the sub-processes and activities that enable statistical analysts to understand the statistics produced. For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase occurs in every iteration. The &quot;Analyse&quot; phase and sub-processes are generic for all statistical outputs, regardless of how the data were sourced.

85	The &quot;Analyse&quot; phase is broken down into five sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative. The sub-processes are:

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="Build (GSBPM)" id="d1823ce3-d9f2-46f1-994c-95ead5be791f">
        <documentation>55. 	This phase builds and tests the production solution to the point where it is ready for use in the &quot;live&quot; environment. The outputs of the &quot;Design&quot; phase direct the selection of reusable processes, instruments, information, and services that are assembled and configured in this phase to create the complete operational environment to run the process. New services are built by exception, created in response to gaps in the existing catalogue of services sourced from within the organisation and externally. These new services are constructed to be broadly reusable within the statistical production architecture.

56. 	For statistical outputs produced on a regular basis, this phase usually occurs for the first iteration, and following a review or a change in methodology or technology, rather than for every iteration. 

57. 	It is broken down into seven sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative. These sub-processes are:

      </element>
      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="Collect (GSBPM)" id="20e25d8a-4c0e-4c31-82c8-7549de5a88e8">
        <documentation>65. 	This phase collects or gathers all necessary information (data and metadata), using different collection modes (including extractions from statistical, administrative and other non-statistical registers and databases), and loads them into the appropriate environment for further processing. Whilst it can include validation of data set formats, it does not include any transformations of the data themselves, as these are all done in the &quot;Process&quot; phase. For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase occurs in each iteration.

66. 	The &quot;Collect&quot; phase is broken down into four sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative. These sub-processes are:

        <documentation>46. 	This phase describes the development and design activities, and any associated practical research work needed to define the statistical outputs, concepts, methodologies, collection instruments  and operational processes. It includes all the design elements needed to define or refine the statistical products or services identified in the business case.  This phase specifies all relevant metadata, ready for use later in the statistical business process, as well as quality assurance procedures. For statistical outputs produced on a regular basis, this phase usually occurs for the first iteration, and whenever improvement actions are identified in the Evaluate phase of a previous iteration. 

47. 	Design activities make substantial use of international and national standards, in order to reduce the length and cost of the design process, and enhance to comparability and usability of outputs. Organisations are also encouraged to reuse or adapt design elements from existing processes. Additionally, outputs of design processes may form the basis for future standards at the organisation, national or international levels.

48. 	This phase is broken down into six sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative. These sub-processes are:

        <documentation>91. 	This phase manages the release of the statistical products to customers. It includes all activities associated with assembling and releasing a range of static and dynamic products via a range of channels. These activities support customers to access and use the outputs released by the statistical organisation.

92. 	For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase occurs in each iteration. It is made up of five sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative. These sub-processes are:

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="Evaluate (GSBPM)" id="b3cdd65e-d848-4007-93d2-7da061c51a80">
        <documentation>99. 	This phase manages the evaluation of a specific instance of a statistical business process, as opposed to the more general over-arching process of statistical quality management described in Section VI. It logically takes place at the end of the instance of the process, but relies on inputs gathered throughout the different phases. It includes evaluating the success of a specific instance of the statistical business process, drawing on a range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and identifying and prioritising potential improvements.

100. 	For statistical outputs produced regularly, evaluation should, at least in theory occur for each iteration, determining whether future iterations should take place, and if so, whether any improvements should be implemented. However, in some cases, particularly for regular and well established statistical business processes, evaluation may not be formally carried out for each iteration. In such cases, this phase can be seen as providing the decision as to whether the next iteration should start from the Specify Needs phase, or from some later phase (often the Collect phase).

101. 	This phase is made up of three sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but which can overlap to some extent in practice. These sub-processes are:

        <documentation>72. 	This phase describes the cleaning of data and their preparation for analysis. It is made up of sub-processes that check, clean, and transform input data, so that they can be analysed and disseminated as statistical outputs. It may be repeated several times if necessary. For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase occurs in each iteration. The sub-processes in this phase can apply to data from both statistical and non-statistical sources (with the possible exception of sub-process 5.6 (Calculate weights), which is usually specific to survey data).

73. 	The &quot;Process&quot; and &quot;Analyse&quot; phases can be iterative and parallel. Analysis can reveal a broader understanding of the data, which might make it apparent that additional processing is needed. Activities within the &quot;Process&quot; and &quot;Analyse&quot; phases may commence before the &quot;Collect&quot; phase is completed. This enables the compilation of provisional results where timeliness is an important concern for users, and increases the time available for analysis.

74. 	This phase is broken down into eight sub-processes, which may be sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative. These sub-processes are:

        <documentation>37. 	This phase is triggered when a need for new statistics is identified, or feedback about current statistics initiates a review. It includes all activities associated with engaging customers to identify their detailed statistical needs, proposing high level solution options and preparing business cases to meet these needs.

38. 	In this phase the organisation:

•	identifies the need for the statistics;
•	confirms, in more detail, the statistical needs of the stakeholders;
•	establishes the high level objectives of the statistical outputs;
•	identifies the relevant concepts and variables for which data are required;
•	checks the extent to which current data sources can meet these needs;
•	prepares the business case to get approval to produce the statistics.

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="Metadata Management (GSBPM)" id="9bac7234-ab78-4c48-8d46-364e6182ebfa">
        <documentation>115. 	Good metadata management is essential for the efficient operation of statistical business processes. Metadata are present in every phase, either created or carried forward from a previous phase. In the context of this model, the emphasis of the over-arching process of metadata management is on the creation, use and archiving of statistical metadata, though metadata on the different sub-processes themselves are also of interest, including as an input for quality management. The key challenge is to ensure that these metadata are captured as early as possible, and stored and transferred from phase to phase alongside the data they refer to. Metadata management strategy and systems are therefore vital to the operation of this model, and these can be facilitated by the GSIM.

116. 	The GSIM is a reference framework of information objects, which enables generic descriptions of the definition, management and use of data and metadata throughout the statistical production process. The GSIM supports a consistent approach to metadata, facilitating the primary role for metadata envisaged in Part A of the Common Metadata Framework  &quot;Statistical Metadata in a Corporate Context&quot;, that is, that metadata should uniquely and formally define the content and links between objects and processes in the statistical information system.

117. 	Part A of the Common Metadata Framework also identifies the following sixteen core principles for metadata management, all of which are intended to be covered in the over-arching Metadata Management process, and taken into the consideration when designing and implementing a statistical metadata system. The principles are presented in four groups (for more information, see the view principles)

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="Quality Management (GSBPM)" id="35df2ca7-bc34-43ce-8dfa-b812579b6b24">
        <documentation>106. 	Quality concerns organisations, processes and products. In the present framework, quality management over-arching process refers mainly to product and process quality.

107. 	The main goal of quality management within the statistical business process is to understand and manage the quality of the statistical products. There is general agreement among statistical organisations that quality should be defined according to the ISO 9000-2005 standard: “The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements&quot; . Thus, product quality is a complex and multi-faceted concept, usually defined in terms of several quality dimensions. The dimensions of quality that are considered most important depend on user perspectives, needs and priorities, which vary between processes and across groups of users.

108. 	In order to improve the product quality, quality management should be present throughout the statistical business process model. It is closely linked to Phase 8 (Evaluate), which has the specific role of post-evaluating individual instances of a statistical business process. However, quality management has both a deeper and broader scope. As well as evaluating iterations of a process, it is also necessary to evaluate separate phases and sub-processes, ideally each time they are applied, but at least according to an agreed schedule. Metadata generated by the different sub-processes themselves are also of interest as an input for process quality management. These evaluations can apply within a specific process, or across several processes that use common components.

109. 	In addition, a fundamental role in quality management is played by the set of quality control actions that should be implemented within the sub-processes to prevent and monitor errors. The strategy could be reported in a quality assurance plan.

110. 	Within an organisation, quality management will usually refer to a specific quality framework, and may therefore take different forms and deliver different results within different organisations. The current multiplicity of quality frameworks enhances the importance of the benchmarking and peer review approaches to evaluation, and whilst these approaches are unlikely to be feasible for every iteration of every part of every statistical business process, they should be used in a systematic way according to a pre-determined schedule that allows for the review of all main parts of the process within a specified time period .

111. 	Broadening the field of application of the quality management over-arching process, evaluation of groups of statistical business processes can also be considered, in order to identify potential duplication or gaps.

112. 	All evaluations result in feedback, which should be used to improve the relevant process, phase or sub-process, creating a quality loop.

113. 	Examples of quality management activities include:
•	Setting and maintaining of the quality framework;
•	Setting of global quality criteria;
•	Setting process quality targets and monitoring compliance;
•	Seeking and analysing user feedback;
•	Reviewing operation and documenting lessons learned;
•	Examining process metadata and quality indicators;
•	Internal or external auditing on statistical processes.

114. 	Quality management also involves institutional and organisational factors. Such factors are included in other GSBPM over-arching processes (e.g. Human resources management, Statistical programme management) although they can have an impact on quality.

These activities contribute to the building and enhancing of shared statistical capabilities managed by partners, leading to increased statistical understanding and improved application and use. They include organisation and coordination of other organisations which produce official statistics as part of a national system. These include:
•	Build and maintain strategic relations, nationally and internationally
•	Build and maintain external statistical excellence
•	Advance inter-agency and international collaborations
•	Secure support for statistical product and service and capability portfolio
•	Coordinate the national statistical system

        <documentation>These activities aim at planning the best way forward to develop a new capability or improve an organisation's capabilities. They require a thorough organisational view of change requirements, the prioritisation of options through an efficient, iterative approval process until a work programme for capability improvements is finalised. These activities further coordinate the planning and resourcing of cross-cutting / reusable capability improvement projects (both large and small), to ensure key improvement work is integrated across the organisation, with interdependencies understood and the resources optimized across the work programme. These activities also monitor the ongoing progress of the work programme and report to the relevant governance fora to ensure all required change requests occur in an efficient and effective manner. These include:
•	Identify disruptions and capability improvements
•	Propose capability improvement projects
•	Manage capability improvement programmes

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessRole" name="Big Data Application Provider" id="3fa95ff9-5484-49b9-967c-bebd5bb9bd42">
        <documentation>The Big Data Application Provider role executes a specific set of operations along the data life cycle to meet the requirements established by the System Orchestrator, as well as meeting security and privacy requirements. The Big Data Application Provider is the architecture component that encapsulates the business logic and functionality to be executed by the architecture. The Big Data Application Provider activities include the following:
• Collection,
• Preparation,
• Analytics,
• Visualization, and
• Access.

These activities are represented by the subcomponents of the Big Data Application Provider as shown in Figure 2. The execution of these activities would typically be specific to the application and, therefore, are not candidates for standardization. However, the metadata and the policies defined and exchanged between the application’s subcomponents could be standardized when the application is specific to a vertical industry.

While many of these activities exist in traditional data processing systems, the data volume, velocity, variety, and variability present in Big Data systems radically change their implementation. Traditional algorithms and mechanisms of traditional data processing implementations need to be adjusted and optimized to create applications that are responsive and can grow to handle ever-growing data collections.

As data propagates through the ecosystem, it is being processed and transformed in different ways in order to extract the value from the information. Each activity of the Big Data Application Provider can be implemented by independent stakeholders and deployed as stand-alone services.

The Big Data Application Provider can be a single instance or a collection of more granular Big Data Application Providers, each implementing different steps in the data life cycle. Each of the activities of the Big Data Application Provider may be a general service invoked by the System Orchestrator, Data Provider, or Data Consumer, such as a web server, a file server, a collection of one or more application programs, or a combination. There may be multiple and differing instances of each activity or a single program may perform multiple activities. Each of the activities is able to interact with the underlying Big Data Framework Providers as well as with the Data Providers and Data Consumers. In addition, these activities may execute in parallel or in any number of sequences and will frequently communicate with each other through the messaging/communications element of the Big Data Framework Provider. Also, the functions of the Big Data Application Provider, specifically the collection and access activities, will interact with the Security and Privacy Fabric to perform authentication/authorization and record/maintain data provenance.

Each of the functions can run on a separate Big Data Framework Provider or all can use a common Big Data Framework Provider. The considerations behind these different system approaches would depend on potentially different technological needs, business and/or deployment constraints (including privacy), and other policy considerations. The baseline NBDRA does not show the underlying technologies, business considerations, and topological constraints, thus making it applicable to any kind of system approach and deployment.

For example, the infrastructure of the Big Data Application Provider would be represented as one of the Big Data Framework Providers. If the Big Data Application Provider uses external/outsourced infrastructures as well, it or they will be represented as another or multiple Big Data Framework Providers in the NBDRA. The multiple blocks behind the Big Data Framework Providers in Figure 2 indicate that multiple Big Data Framework Providers can support a single Big Data Application Provider.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessRole" name="Big Data Framework Provider" id="51faefe4-527a-4a6f-90d5-da01700ec7c9">
        <documentation>The Big Data Framework Provider typically consists of one or more hierarchically organized instances of the components in the NBDRA IT value chain (Figure 2). There is no requirement that all instances at a given level in the hierarchy be of the same technology. In fact, most Big Data implementations are hybrids that combine multiple technology approaches in order to provide flexibility or meet the complete range of requirements, which are driven from the Big Data Application Provider.

Many of the recent advances related to Big Data have been in the area of frameworks designed to scale to Big Data needs (e.g., addressing volume, variety, velocity, and variability) while maintaining linear or near-linear performance. These advances have generated much of the technology excitement in the Big Data space. Accordingly, there is a great deal more information available in the frameworks area compared to the other components, and the additional detail provided for the Big Data Framework Provider in this document reflects this imbalance.

The Big Data Framework Provider comprises the following three sub-roles (from the bottom to the top):
• Infrastructure Frameworks,
• Data Platform Frameworks, and
• Processing Frameworks.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessRole" name="Data Consumer" id="18e1737d-d9db-4362-8a06-7f1036dcaa31">
        <documentation>Similar to the Data Provider, the role of Data Consumer within the NBDRA can be an actual end user or another system. In many ways, this role is the mirror image of the Data Provider, with the entire Big Data framework appearing like a Data Provider to the Data Consumer. The activities associated with the Data Consumer role include the following:
• Search and Retrieve,
• Download,
• Analyze Locally,
• Reporting,
• Visualization, and
• Data to Use for Their Own Processes.

The Data Consumer uses the interfaces or services provided by the Big Data Application Provider to get access to the information of interest. These interfaces can include data reporting, data retrieval, and data rendering.

This role will generally interact with the Big Data Application Provider through its access function to execute the analytics and visualizations implemented by the Big Data Application Provider. This interaction may be demand-based, where the Data Consumer initiates the command/transaction and the Big Data Application Provider replies with the answer. The interaction could include interactive visualizations, creating reports, or drilling down through data using business intelligence functions provided by the Big Data Application Provider. Alternately, the interaction may be stream- or push-based, where the Data Consumer simply subscribes or listens for one or more automated outputs from the application. In almost all cases, the Security and Privacy fabric around the Big Data architecture would support the authentication and authorization between the Data Consumer and the architecture, with either side able to perform the role of authenticator/authorizer and the other side providing the credentials. Like the interface between the Big Data architecture and the Data Provider, the interface between the Data Consumer and Big Data Application Provider would also pass through the three distinct phases of initiation, data transfer, and termination.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessRole" name="Data Provider" id="ab3cb6c9-be11-4db4-b390-41175dcd0fad">
        <documentation>The Data Provider role introduces new data or information feeds into the Big Data system for discovery, access, and transformation by the Big Data system. New data feeds are distinct from the data already in use by the system and residing in the various system repositories. Similar technologies can be used to access both new data feeds and existing data. The Data Provider actors can be anything from a sensor, to a human inputting data manually, to another Big Data system.

One of the important characteristics of a Big Data system is the ability to import and use data from a variety of data sources. Data sources can be internal or public records, tapes, images, audio, videos, sensor data, web logs, system and audit logs, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookies, and other sources. Humans, machines, sensors, online and offline applications, Internet technologies, and other actors can also produce data sources. The roles of Data Provider and Big Data Application Provider often belong to different organizations, unless the organization implementing the Big Data Application Provider owns the data sources. Consequently, data from different sources may have different security and privacy considerations. In fulfilling its role, the Data Provider creates an abstraction of the data sources. In the case of raw data sources, the Data Provider can potentially cleanse, correct, and store the data in an internal format that is accessible to the Big Data system that will ingest it.

The Data Provider can also provide an abstraction of data previously transformed by another system (i.e., legacy system, another Big Data system). In this case, the Data Provider would represent a Data Consumer of the other system. For example, Data Provider 1 could generate a streaming data source from the operations performed by Data Provider 2 on a dataset at rest.

Data Provider activities include the following, which are common to most systems that handle data:
• Collecting the data;
• Persisting the data;
• Providing transformation functions for data scrubbing of sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII);
• Creating the metadata describing the data source(s), usage policies/access rights, and other relevant attributes;
• Enforcing access rights on data access;
• Establishing formal or informal contracts for data access authorizations;
• Making the data accessible through suitable programmable push or pull interfaces;
• Providing push or pull access mechanisms; and
• Publishing the availability of the information and the means to access it.

The Data Provider exposes a collection of interfaces (or services) for discovering and accessing the data. These interfaces would typically include a registry so that applications can locate a Data Provider, identify the data of interest it contains, understand the types of access allowed, understand the types of analysis supported, locate the data source, determine data access methods, identify the data security requirements, identify the data privacy requirements, and other pertinent information. Therefore, the interface would provide the means to register the data source, query the registry, and identify a standard set of data contained by the registry.

Subject to Big Data characteristics (i.e., volume, variety, velocity, and variability) and system design considerations, interfaces for exposing and accessing data would vary in their complexity and can include both push and pull software mechanisms. These mechanisms can include subscription to events, listening to data feeds, querying for specific data properties or content, and the ability to submit a code for execution to process the data in situ. Because the data can be too large to economically move across the network, the interface could also allow the submission of analysis requests (e.g., software code implementing a certain algorithm for execution), with the results returned to the requestor. Data access may not always be automated, but might involve a human role logging into the system and providing directions where new data should be transferred (e.g., establishing a subscription to an email-based data feed).

The interface between the Data Provider and Big Data Application Provider typically will go through three phases: initiation, data transfer, and termination. The initiation phase is started by either party and often includes some level of authentication/authorization. The phase may also include queries for metadata about the source or consumer, such as the list of available topics in a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model and the transfer of any parameters (e.g., object count/size limits or target storage locations). Alternatively, the phase may be as simple as one side opening a socket connection to a known port on the other side.

The data transfer phase may be a push from the Data Provider or a pull by the Big Data Application Provider. It may also be a singular transfer or involve multiple repeating transfers. In a repeating transfer situation, the data may be a continuous stream of transactions/records/bytes. In a push scenario, the Big Data Application Provider must be prepared to accept the data asynchronously but may also be required to acknowledge (or negatively acknowledge) the receipt of each unit of data. In a pull scenario, the Big Data Application Provider would specifically generate a request that defines through parameters of the data to be returned. The returned data could itself be a stream or multiple records/units of data, and the data transfer phase may consist of multiple request/send transactions.

The termination phase could be as simple as one side simply dropping the connection or could include checksums, counts, hashes, or other information about the completed transfer.</documentation>

        <documentation>The Big Data characteristics of volume, velocity, variety, and variability demand a versatile management platform for storing, processing, and managing complex data. Management of Big Data systems should handle both system- and data-related aspects of the Big Data environment. The Management Fabric of the NBDRA encompasses two general groups of activities: system management and Big Data life cycle management (BDLM). System management includes activities such as provisioning, configuration, package management, software management, backup management, capability management, resources management, and performance management. BDLM involves activities surrounding the data life cycle of collection, preparation/curation, analytics, visualization, and access.

As discussed above, the NBDRA represents a broad range of Big Data systems—from tightly coupled enterprise solutions integrated by standard or proprietary interfaces to loosely coupled vertical systems maintained by a variety of stakeholders or authorities bound by agreements, standard interfaces, or de facto standard interfaces. Therefore, different considerations and technical solutions would be applicable for different cases.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessRole" name="Security and Privacy" id="1566bcf5-8b09-4189-a4be-d1e917c6220e">
        <documentation>Security and privacy considerations form a fundamental aspect of the NBDRA. This is geometrically depicted in Figure 2 by the Security and Privacy Fabric surrounding the five main components, indicating that all components are affected by security and privacy considerations. Thus, the role of security and privacy is correctly depicted in relation to the components but does not expand into finer details, which may be more accurate but are best relegated to a more detailed security and privacy reference architecture. The Data Provider and Data Consumer are included in the Security and Privacy Fabric since, at the least, they may often nominally agree on security protocols and mechanisms. The Security and Privacy Fabric is an approximate representation that alludes to the intricate interconnected nature and ubiquity of security and privacy throughout the NBDRA. Additional details about the Security and Privacy Fabric are included in the NIST Interoperability Framework: Volume 4, Security and Privacy document.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessRole" name="System Orchestrator" id="ea84971d-c381-4bd7-b0fe-191c6419b303">
        <documentation>The System Orchestrator role includes defining and integrating the required data application activities into an operational vertical system. Typically, the System Orchestrator involves a collection of more specific roles, performed by one or more actors, which manage and orchestrate the operation of the Big Data system. These actors may be human components, software components, or some combination of the two. The function of the System Orchestrator is to configure and manage the other components of the Big Data architecture to implement one or more workloads that the architecture is designed to execute. The workloads managed by the System Orchestrator may be assigning/provisioning framework components to individual physical or virtual nodes at the lower level, or providing a graphical user interface that supports the specification of workflows linking together multiple applications and components at the higher level. The System Orchestrator may also, through the Management Fabric, monitor the workloads and system to confirm that specific quality of service requirements are met for each workload, and may actually elastically assign and provision additional physical or virtual resources to meet workload requirements resulting from changes/surges in the data or number of users/transactions.

The NBDRA represents a broad range of Big Data systems, from tightly coupled enterprise solutions (integrated by standard or proprietary interfaces) to loosely coupled vertical systems maintained by a variety of stakeholders bounded by agreements and standard or standard-de-facto interfaces.

In an enterprise environment, the System Orchestrator role is typically centralized and can be mapped to the traditional role of system governor that provides the overarching requirements and constraints, which the system must fulfill, including policy, architecture, resources, or business requirements. A system governor works with a collection of other roles (e.g., data manager, data security, and system manager) to implement the requirements and the system’s functionality.

In a loosely coupled vertical system, the System Orchestrator role is typically decentralized. Each independent stakeholder is responsible for its own system management, security, and integration, as well as integration within the Big Data distributed system using the interfaces provided by other stakeholders.</documentation>

        <documentation>The access activity within the Big Data Application Provider is focused on the communication/interaction with the Data Consumer. Similar to the collection activity, the access activity may be a generic service such as a web server or application server that is configured by the System Orchestrator to handle specific requests from the Data Consumer. This activity would interface with the visualization and analytic activities to respond to requests from the Data Consumer (who may be a person) and uses the processing and platform frameworks to retrieve data to respond to Data Consumer requests. In addition, the access activity confirms that descriptive and administrative metadata and metadata schemes are captured and maintained for access by the Data Consumer and as data is transferred to the Data Consumer. The interface with the Data Consumer may be synchronous or asynchronous in nature and may use a pull or push paradigm for data transfer.</documentation>

        <documentation>The analytics activity of the Big Data Application Provider includes the encoding of the low-level business logic of the Big Data system (with higher-level business process logic being encoded by the System Orchestrator). The activity implements the techniques to extract knowledge from the data based on the requirements of the vertical application. The requirements specify the data processing algorithms for processing the data to produce new insights that will address the technical goal. The analytics activity will leverage the processing frameworks to implement the associated logic. This typically involves the activity providing software that implements the analytic logic to the batch and/or streaming elements of the processing framework for execution. The messaging/communication framework of the Big Data Framework Provider may be used to pass data or control functions to the application logic running in the processing frameworks. The analytic logic may be broken up into multiple modules to be executed by the processing frameworks which communicate, through the messaging/communication framework, with each other and other functions instantiated by the Big Data Application Provider.</documentation>

        <documentation>In general, the collection activity of the Big Data Application Provider handles the interface with the Data Provider. This may be a general service, such as a file server or web server configured by the System Orchestrator to accept or perform specific collections of data, or it may be an application-specific service designed to pull data or receive pushes of data from the Data Provider. Since this activity is receiving data at a minimum, it must store/buffer the received data until it is persisted through the Big Data Framework Provider. This persistence need not be to physical media but may simply be to an in-memory queue or other service provided by the processing frameworks of the Big Data Framework Provider. The collection activity is likely where the extraction portion of the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)/Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) cycle is performed. At the initial collection stage, sets of data (e.g., data records) of similar structure are collected (and combined), resulting in uniform security, policy, and other considerations. Initial metadata is created (e.g., subjects with keys are identified) to facilitate subsequent aggregation or look-up methods.</documentation>

These activity classes reflect the underlying operations performed on data within the system to include: Transmission, Reception, Storage, Manipulation, and Retrieval. These activities may be associated with physical or virtual infrastructure resources. In defining the specific activities for a given system, the focus should be on specific types of activities. For example, a system which requires highly parallel processing of large matrices or data may specify an activity which supports Single Instruction Multiple Data computing, such as that provided by Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Transmission activities may include descriptions of data transmission requirements which define the required throughput and latency.

82. The ability to manage the life cycle of data through the implementation of policies, processes and rules in accordance with the organisation's strategic objectives.
- Allocation of ownership and stewardship roles around the data
- Data sensitivity classification
- Security and access policies management
- Data Quality management
- Retention management
- Usage and performance monitoring
- Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery

Description
83. One of the main aims of data governance is to ensure that the data has consistency and that it is trustworthy. It is important that the allocation of the ownership and stewardship need to be maintained through implementing a data governance framework, this involves defining the owners or custodians of the data assets in the enterprise. This role is called data stewardship. The data sensitivity classification is key step to building a secure organisation. Classifying the data is the process of categorising data assets based on nominal values according to its sensitivity (e.g. impact of applicable laws and regulations).

84. Security is a capability that is closely linked to data governance; this is described in more detail in another capability (see 5.8 Security and Information Security). However, data governance has a responsibility to manage aspects of the policies relating to security and access.

85. The quality of statistical data is also of paramount importance, as poor quality data will undoubtedly inflict reputational damage upon the organisation. Therefore, it is imperative that quality management processes and controls are applied at all appropriate stages of processing. Data Quality management should ensure that the appropriate quality framework is used to guide these controls. As well as the possibility of reputational damage, poor data quality management could also affect the reliability of business analytics and business intelligence reporting.

86. Data retention management defines the policies of persistent data and records management for meeting legal and business data archival requirements. These policies should outline the criteria for archiving data (which would probably be quite numerous, considering the numbers and types of datasets managed by statistical organisations), and the processes for managing historical data.

87. The usage and performance monitoring need to include data logging and visualisation tools that can monitor and analyse network performance, usage patterns. The data should always be hosted in secure environment relevant to the correct security qualification of that unique data set, these facilities can be on-premise, hybrid or in the Cloud, all with an approved back up and business continuity policy.

88. The effort and resource put into business continuity and disaster recovery will normally be appropriate to the risk presented by the loss of the data in question. For example, if there is loss of data for a particularly important financial indicator which prevents publication at the appropriate time, the impact on not only institutional reputation, but also on the international financial markets themselves could be extreme – therefore, in this situation, business continuity is extremely important.</documentation>

        <documentation>Summary
54. The ability to transform raw data stored within the organisation to make them correct and usable for statistical production.

Description
55. Data Transformation is the ability to transform data (already digested and stored within the organisation) in a format that is (re-)usable for the provisioning capability. During the transformation process, the data can be cleansed, reformatted, harmonised, enriched, and validated. Data transformation allows the mapping of the data from its given format into the format expected by the appropriate application. This includes value conversions or translation functions, as well as normalising numeric values to conform to minimum and maximum values.

56. Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a data set and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data. Data cleansing may be performed interactively with data preparation (data wrangling) tools, or as batch processing through scripting. The actual process of data cleansing may involve removing typographical errors or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities. Data Cleansing will not change the data model.

57. Reformatting is often needed to convert data to the same (standard) type. This often happens when talking about dates or time zones.

58. Harmonisation of the data is the process of minimising redundant or conflicting dimensions that may have evolved independently. Goal is to find common dimensions, reduce complexity and help to unify definitions. For example, harmonisation of short codes (st, rd, etc.) to actual words (street, road, etc.). Standardisation of data is a means of changing a reference data set to a new standard, ex, use of standard codes.

59. After cleansing and reformatting, a data set should be consistent with other similar data sets in the system. The inconsistencies detected or removed may have been originally caused by user entry errors, by corruption in transmission or storage, or by different data dictionary definitions of similar entities in different stores. Data cleansing differs from data validation in that validation almost invariably means data is rejected from the system at entry and is performed at the time of entry, rather than on batches of data.

60. Data Validation may be strict (such as rejecting any address that does not have a valid postal code) or fuzzy (such as correcting records that partially match existing, known records). Validation of data quality (no impact on data model and data). The result will mainly produce quality indicators. Data Validation will not change the data model. Some data cleansing solutions will clean data by cross checking with a validated data set.

61. A common data cleansing practice is data enrichment (aka enhancement), where data is made more complete by adding related information. For example, appending addresses with any phone numbers related to that address. Data Enrichment can change the data model.

62. The required capability includes:
- Clean the data to preserve internal coherence of data: correcting input errors, checking duplicates, imputing missing data, verify and correct data formats, checking inconsistent data and unaccepted values
- Check the coherence of data with data definitions coming from metadata system used in the organisation
- Check the harmonisation with classifications coming from national and international standards, correcting and imputing the right values
- Support the Process phase of the GSBPM by allowing for general data processing: creation of new derived variables, use of standard codes
- Define and create aggregations to be used for dissemination system
- Code data coming from textual or non-structured sources, looking up data from classifications and codelists
- Match data from different sources, standardising codes (ref Data Integration)
- Reduce the amount of data, filtering rows and selecting columns
- Alter the data following security or statistical significance reasons
- Ensure consistency synchronising data between different repositories</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="Data Ingestion" id="e5abf05b-b967-45e7-b9f2-ddadd58d1b9a">
        <documentation>Summary
40. The ability to receive data from external sources or providers. This includes:
Accessing data sources through a variety of channels (for example API, web questionnaires, administrative archives, streaming data, etc.)
Loading data into a storage facility (for example relational database, NoSQL, big data storage, etc.)
Utilising the metadata management capability to capture the relevant information about the ingested data
Managing the relationship with data providers (for example respondent management and Service Level Agreements for administrative data sources)

41. Note that sample design and drawing a sample are out of scope for this capability.

Description
42. Data ingestion is the first step in the typical statistical production process, and an essential one: no statistical information can be built without data. We call &quot;data ingestion&quot; the capability that consists in establishing and securing data provision agreements with relevant providers, creating reliable data provision channels with existing sources, acquiring the data under specified formats and loading it in a controlled data storage environment, and creating (or using existing) metadata to describe the data and acquisition process.

43. Deciding what sources of data are interesting for creating or enriching statistics is a preliminary step. It builds on a good evaluation of users’ needs and implies a good knowledge of the data and information landscape. In some cases, new data needs to be acquired and corresponding collection instruments (typically survey questionnaires) have to be designed and created. In other cases, existing data can cover the needs and the problem is to secure access to it.

44. In the case of data coming from external sources, we have to assess the reliability of the source and its stability in terms of time and format. For data coming from private companies, additional actions needs to be performed regarding the assessment of the reliability of the provider and its willingness to provide the data. In some cases, it can be necessary to act on the legislative level to secure data provision, which requires specific competences. In any case, clear contracts need to be set up and managed in time with the providers.

45. Once access to data is ensured, it is necessary to design and implement the operational solution that will bring the data to a storage or processing facility controlled by the statistical organisation. This includes technical (network, file transfer, data capture, web scraping, etc.) as well as organisational (monitoring, verification, etc.) aspects. Some modification treatments can be applied to facilitate data integration, such as filtering, transcoding, normalisation, translation, codification, etc.

46. The Data Ingestion capability is very connected to the Metadata Management capability. First, it is important to capture metadata about the structure, quality, provenance of the data, and about the ingestion process itself. Second, metadata can be used in an active way in the data ingestion process, for example for the automatic generation of collection instruments or of parts of the ingestion process.</documentation>

        <documentation>Summary
72. The ability to record, maintain, validate and query at the semantic level all metadata relevant to the statistical organisation, and connect them with data sets.

Description
73. Metadata has a dual aspect in the framework of a data architecture. On one hand, metadata is data, and as such all the capabilities and building blocks defined in CSDA apply to metadata. On the other hand, metadata has a special status since it conveys all the context needed to understand the data: without metadata, data is useless. Therefore, metadata represents a particularly valuable type of data, and is actually the organisation's most precious asset.

74. Metadata lives at the semantic level, and thus specific features apply to its management. Particularly relevant aspects for metadata are:
- semantic consistency
- conformance to standards
- actionability

75. Semantic consistency means, for example, that metadata is precisely defined according to a well-known modelling framework, and that coherent naming rules are established and applied throughout the organisation. This could require specific skills and organisational measures.

76. Conformance to standards is a good way to achieve semantic consistency, since standards usually undergo collaborative production processes that confer them a high quality level. It is also essential to interoperability between organisations, notably at an international level. It may be useful for statistical organisations to participate in the governance of the standards that they use.

77. Actionability is an important characteristic of metadata. It means that metadata is not only documentation, but that it is used actively in the statistical production process. For example:
- Descriptive metadata used for generating parts of the statistical process or given tools like data collection instruments.
- Discoverability metadata used to localise and access data sets, as mentioned in 5.4 – Provisioning

78. Actionability usually implies that metadata is stored in specific machine-actionable formats, which requires particular expertise.

79. Specific attention must be given to metadata for data coming from external sources, like Big Data. In this case, metadata must be obtained in collaboration with data provider, trying to set up common standards and vocabularies.</documentation>

91. The ability to manage and obtain provenance and lineage of data.

Description
92. Official Statistics will increasingly use data from different sources (both corporate and external). In order to be able to assess the quality of the data product built on these data, information on data's origin is required. The provenance and lineage data can be information on processes, methods and data sources that led to product as well as timeliness of data and annotation from curation experts.

93. Provenance is information about the source of the data and lineage is information on the changes that have occurred to the data over its life-cycle. Together they both provide the complete traceability of where data has resided and what actions have been performed on the data over the course of its life.

94. This capability entails the recording, maintenance and tracking of the sources of data, and any changes to that data throughout its life-cycle, in particular it should include date/timestamps, and who/what carried out the changes.

95. World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)7 provides an ontology to express provenance and lineage data.</documentation>

        <documentation>Summary
65. The ability to make data and metadata available to authorised internal and external users and processes. The required capability is:
- Metadata-driven access to data sets, for example APIs or through a data catalogue (provided via the metadata management capability)
- Providing direct access to data through data analysis tools or APIs or query languages
- Access and disseminate data using open standards

Description
Metadata-driven access to data sets
66. The available data needs to be findable by using a data catalogue that provides an identifier that gives access to the referenced data set. The data catalogue capability is covered by the metadata management capability. The information provided by the Provision capability should be enough to access the data sets via tools or machine-to-machine interfaces. All data sets should be findable based on their metadata. The overview of all found relevant data sets should be ranked to distinguish the most relevant from the less relevant data sets.

Providing direct access to data through data analysis tools or APIs or query languages
67. This capability makes it possible to access data through analysis tools (e.g. statistical analysis, data preparation, visualisation, dashboarding, business intelligence) using standard protocols (e.g. ODBC, JDBC, web services (SOAP / Restful)) or through APIs or using standard query languages like SPARQL or GraphQL. This also includes a description of the used/needed authentication and authorisation to access the data sets and the selection and filtering options to retrieve the data.

Providing access to data using open standards
68. Standards for accessing data e.g. open standards. All data should be (if applicable) accessible for external parties using open data standards. Public data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. For data exchange, the OData protocol is recommended. In computing, Open Data Protocol (OData) is an open protocol that allows the creation and consumption of queryable and interoperable RESTful APIs in a simple and standard way.

Enforcing security
69. It must be possible to enforce security on all data sets; the building blocks to make this possible are described in 5.8 - Security and Information Assurance (Current work version). Reduce quantity of data following security or statistical significance reasons.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessFunction" name="Security &amp; Information Assurance" id="29796803-cdf6-4f37-81c8-3bd42e97d652">
        <documentation>Summary
98. Security and Information Assurance is the ability to grant security and continuity to the information system, and will provide the following controls:
- Granting access to authenticated and authorised users and successfully deny access to all others
- Applying security to data in transit and at rest, to an appropriate level in line with the relevant official security classifications and Privacy Impact Assessments (if applicable)
- Ensuring the preservation of the integrity and availability of data
- Ensuring the business continuity of the system, putting in place the capability to overcome temporary problems and ensuring the availability of alternative sites in the event of a disaster
- Detecting hardware and software errors and bring the system back to a consistent state
- Managing security rules, also in connection with external systems providing data (either administrative sources or Big Data)
- Monitoring user actions to identify security breaches
- Providing intrusion detection and intrusion prevention to the hosted infrastructure
- Protecting user privacy
- The use of data encryption techniques where applicable.

Description
99. The provision of Information Assurance and Security in an ever changing statistical data world has to be fluid. This is due to the changing IT landscape with an ever increasing drive to Big Data.

100. The fundamental ethos for Security and Information Assurance to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data remains unchanged, regardless of the sources of the data.

101. It is important that the security of the statistical organisation engenders trust from the stakeholders, whether it be data suppliers (whose interest would be maintaining security of data which is probably confidential), or data consumers (who would be interested in the integrity and quality of the data).

102. With increased access to sources of Big Data, and forging partnerships with other public and private organisations, security is essential. Working with big data is becoming ever more important to national and international statistical systems for fulfilling their mission in society.

103. In order to advance the potential of official statistics, statistical organisations will need to collaborate rather than compete with the private sector. At the same time, they must remain impartial and independent, and invest in communicating the wealth of available digital data to the benefit of stakeholders. We must consider the (now wider) range of data sources, which will include:
- Traditional (paper based) surveys
- On line surveys (in house hosted in cloud)
- On line surveys direct to businesses and individuals
- On line surveys hosted and run by 3rd Parties
- Data purchased from commercial organisations
- Web-scraped data, or other internet-based data sources
- Shared Government data

104. Each of these will have their own inherent security risks associated with them, and each must have the appropriate security controls applied to them. The use of a series of data zones with various levels of security controls can help to cater for the variety of requirements and needs of the different datasets.

105. A major objective of IA and security is to facilitate access to Big Data sources as input into official statistics production. As these sources have their own potential security risks associated with them (e.g. unknown provenance, unknown virus status etc.), particular care needs to be taken to ensure the appropriate level of security controls are applied.

106. Where data is being shared with other organisations, there will be a need to provide assurance that the statistical agency will protect shared data to an acceptable level. This assurance can be facilitated by forming partnerships with the other organisation(s), whether they are public or private sector organisations, and setting up some form of service level agreements where the security controls to be applied to the datasets in question can be agreed. 107. Other data security risks can be realised when data from different sources is matched and linked, especially when applied to person information.

108. Additionally, data should undergo disclosure checking where there is a risk of revealing information about an individual or organisation, especially where, for example, it could lead to detriment to the individual, or commercial damage to a business. This is particularly important for data that is being prepared for publication or dissemination.

109. There will be a need for data to undergo stringent checks when it is being brought into an organisation, regardless of its source and method of ingestion (e.g. streaming, batch, etc.). Multi- AV scanning should be adopted to reduce the risk of infection by viruses.

110. It is important that security and information assurance needs to be considered in the context of the data stored and used by the statistical organisation all through the statistical process.

        <documentation>The data is decoded (messages), transformed, encrypted (crucial fields), zipped and then uploaded to the UNECE sandbox

In this phase, all the necessary information (data and metadata) is collected, using different collection modes, and then loaded into the appropriate environment for further processing.

There are many possible sources for obtaining AIS data (eg public maritime offices, private companies, commercial tracking services) and levels of data (eg national, European, worldwide).

As for the technical aspect of collecting AIS-data, there are two possible approaches:
- transfer of archived historical data
- live streaming data

Regardless of the choice of the AIS data provider, as well as the method of data collection, stability and sustainability of the source is important from the statistical process.

After collecting the data, it is necessary to decode the data. The received AIS message are in NMEA format (raw data), which is a text encoded binary format.

AIS consist of several types of records: dynamic data (information on ship movements, where the message id is 1, 2, 3 or 21) and static and voyage data (information on ship characteristics and current voyage, where the message id is 5).

The timestamps are technically not part of most of the data sources collected, but are transmitted as separate messages in the AIS stream.

After the process of decoding, the AIS data can be uploaded to a Big data cluster/ database, e.g. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). From here the data is available for the further steps of the statistical process.

During this phase, we could choose to filter out only fields necessary for further analysis. This brings back the size of the total data set, making it easier to process the data during the next phases. However, within the rest of the process we should still be able to identify individual ships. Another point of concern is the identification of individual ships in AIS data. Especially when the ship is owned by an individual, the data is personal data. This means that the data should be protected on a technological level.</documentation>

- calculate the number of ships that have entered and departed a port (port visit algorithm)

        <documentation>The aim of this phase is to validate, integrate and transform data to prepare the data for analysis.

In AIS-data, we can specify two types of errors Human errors and Technical errors. Human errors are related to static information (MMSI, IMO number, ship’s name, call sign, type, length) or voyage data (draught, destination). Since an AIS device is an autonomous device on board of the ship, these data are not obligatory to be added automatically. They are entered by change of values (voyage) or by installation of the AIS device (static). It is worth noting that voyage data must be manually updated after each port visit.

Technical errors are related to dynamic data (such as position of ship, speed, course, rotation) which comes from the AIS device (sensors, cables and antenna).

These errors are the result of transmission errors. These transmission errors can be between the GPS network and the device and between the device and the AIS receivers. 
These transmission errors can result in erroneous positions and identification of the vessels. Detailed information on the errors in AIS data can be found in deliverable 4.2.

As part of the sub-process data integration, we can link validated AIS data with data from maritime statistics, using the MMSI number. Thanks to this, it will be possible to explore data in the analyze phase and obtain new statistics or additional knowledge.</documentation>

        <documentation>1.2 Assess situation
Task
Assess situation
This task involves more detailed fact-finding about all of the resources, constraints, assumptions, and other factors that should be considered in determining the data analysis goal and project plan. In the previous task, your objective is to quickly get to the crux of the situation. Here, you want to expand upon the details.

Outputs
Inventory of resources
List the resources available to the project, including personnel (business experts, data experts, technical support, data mining experts), data (fixed extracts, access to live, warehoused, or operational data), computing resources (hardware platforms), and software (data mining tools, other relevant software).

Requirements, assumptions, and constraints
List all requirements of the project, including schedule of completion, comprehensibility and quality of results, and security, as well as legal issues. As part of this output, make sure that you are allowed to use the data.
List the assumptions made by the project. These may be assumptions about the data that can be verified during data mining, but may also include non-verifiable assumptions about the business related to the project. It is particularly important to list the latter if it will affect the validity of the results.
List the constraints on the project. These may be constraints on the availability of resources, but may also include technological constraints such as the size of dataset that it is practical to use for modeling.

Risks and contingencies
List the risks or events that might delay the project or cause it to fail. List the corresponding contingency plans, what action will be taken if these risks or events take place.

Terminology
Compile a glossary of terminology relevant to the project. This may include two components:
(1) A glossary of relevant business terminology, which forms part of the business understanding available to the project. Constructing this glossary is a useful “knowledge elicitation” and education exercise.
(2) A glossary of data mining terminology, illustrated with examples relevant to the business problem in question

Costs and benefits
Construct a cost-benefit analysis for the project, which compares the costs of the project with the potential benefits to the business if it is successful. The comparison should be as specific as possible. For example, use monetary measures in a commercial situation.</documentation>

        <documentation>1.3 Determine data mining goals
Task Determine data mining goals
A business goal states objectives in business terminology. A data mining goal states project objectives in technical terms. For example, the business goal might be “Increase catalog sales to existing customers.” A data mining goal might be “Predict how many widgets a customer will buy, given their purchases over the past three years, demographic information (age, salary, city, etc.), and the price of the item.”

Outputs 
Data mining goals
Describe the intended outputs of the project that enable the achievement of the business objectives.

Data mining success criteria
Define the criteria for a successful outcome to the project in technical terms—for example, a certain level of predictive accuracy or a propensity-to-purchase profile with a given degree of “lift.” As with business success criteria, it may be necessary to describe these in subjective terms, in which case the person or persons making the subjective judgment should be identified.

Task
Produce project plan
Describe the intended plan for achieving the data mining goals and thereby achieving the business goals. The plan should specify the steps to be performed during the rest of the project, including the initial selection of tools and techniques.

Outputs
Project plan
List the stages to be executed in the project, together with their duration, resources required, inputs, outputs, and dependencies. Where possible, make explicit the large-scale iterations in the data mining process—for example, repetitions of the modeling and evaluation phases.
As part of the project plan, it is also important to analyze dependencies between time schedule and risks. Mark results of these analyses explicitly in the project plan, ideally with actions and recommendations if the risks are manifested.
Note: the project plan contains detailed plans for each phase. Decide at this point which evaluation strategy will be used in the evaluation phase.
The project plan is a dynamic document in the sense that at the end of each phase, a review of progress and achievements is necessary and a corresponding update of the project plan is recommended. Specific review points for these updates are part of the project plan.

Initial assessment of tools and techniques
At the end of the first phase, an initial assessment of tools and techniques should be performed. Here, for example, you select a data mining tool that supports various methods for different stages of the process.
It is important to assess tools and techniques early in the process since the selection of tools and techniques may influence the entire project.</documentation>

Task
Verify data quality
Examine the quality of the data, addressing questions such as: Is the data complete (does it cover all the cases required)? Is it correct, or does it contain errors and, if there are errors, how common are they? Are there missing values in the data? If so, how are they represented, where do they occur, and how common are they?

Task
Format data
Formatting transformations refer to primarily syntactic modifications made to the data that do not change its meaning, but might be required by the modeling tool.

Output
Reformatted data
Some tools have requirements on the order of the attributes, such as the first field being a unique identifier for each record or the last field being the outcome field the model is to predict.
It might be important to change the order of the records in the dataset. Perhaps the modeling tool requires that the records be sorted according to the value of the outcome attribute. Commonly, records of the dataset are initially ordered in some way, but the modeling algorithm needs them to be in a fairly random order. For example, when using neural networks, it is generally best for the records to be presented in a random order, although some tools handle this automatically without explicit user intervention.
Additionally, there are purely syntactic changes made to satisfy the requirements of the specific modeling tool. Examples: removing commas from within text fields in comma-delimited data files, trimming all values to a maximum of 32 characters.</documentation>

Task Collect initial data
Acquire the data (or access to the data) listed in the project resources. This initial collection includes data loading, if necessary for data understanding. For example, if you use a specific tool for data understanding, it makes perfect sense to load your data into this tool. This effort possibly leads to initial data preparation steps.
Note: if you acquire multiple data sources, integration is an additional issue, either here or in the later data preparation phase.

        <documentation>3.4 Integrate data
Task
Integrate data
These are methods whereby information is combined from multiple tables or records to create new records or values.

Output
Merged data
Merging tables refers to joining together two or more tables that have different information about the same objects. Example: a retail chain has one table with information about each store’s general characteristics (e.g., floor space, type of mall), another table with summarized sales data (e.g., profit, percent change in sales from previous year), and another with information about the demographics of the surrounding area. Each of these tables contains one record for each store. These tables can be merged together into a new table with one record for each store, combining fields from the source tables.
Merged data also covers aggregations. Aggregation refers to operations in which new values are computed by summarizing information from multiple records and/or tables. For example, converting a table of customer purchases where there is one record for each purchase into a new table where there is one record for each customer, with fields such as number of purchases, average purchase amount, percent of orders charged to credit card, percent of items under promotion, etc.</documentation>

Task
Assess model
The data mining engineer interprets the models according to his domain knowledge, the data mining success criteria, and the desired test design. The data mining engineer judges the success of the application of modeling and discovery techniques technically; he contacts business analysts and domain experts later in order to discuss the data mining results in the business context. Please note that this task only considers models, whereas the evaluation phase also takes into account all other results that were produced in the course of the project.
The data mining engineer tries to rank the models. He assesses the models according to the evaluation criteria. As much as possible, he also takes into account business objectives and business success criteria. In most data mining projects, the data mining engineer applies a single technique more than once, or generates data mining results with several different techniques. In this task, he also compares all results according to the evaluation criteria.

        <documentation>5.1 Evaluate results
Task
Evaluate results
Previous evaluation steps dealt with factors such as the accuracy and generality of the model. This step assesses the degree to which the model meets the business objectives and seeks to determine if there is some business reason why this model is deficient. Another option is to test the model(s) on test applications in the real application, if time and budget constraints permit.
Moreover, evaluation also assesses other data mining results generated. Data mining results involve models that are necessarily related to the original business objectives and all other findings that are not necessarily related to the original business objectives, but might also unveil additional challenges, information, or hints for future directions.

Output
Assessment of data mining results with respect to business success criteria
Summarize assessment results in terms of business success criteria, including a final statement regarding whether the project already meets the initial business objectives.

Approved models
After assessing models with respect to business success criteria, the generated models that meet the selected criteria become the approved models.

Task
Review process
At this point, the resulting models appear to be satisfactory and to satisfy business needs. It is now appropriate to do a more thorough review of the data mining engagement in order to determine if there is any important factor or task that has somehow been overlooked. This review also covers quality assurance issues—for example: Did we correctly build the model? Did we use only the attributes that we are allowed to use and that are available for future analyses?

Task
Determine next steps
Depending on the results of the assessment and the process review, the project team decides how to proceed. The team decides whether to finish this project and move on to deployment, initiate further iterations, or set up new data mining projects. This task includes analyses of remaining resources and budget, which may influence the decisions.

        <documentation>Creation of the model is generally not the end of the project. Even if the purpose of the model is to increase knowledge of the data, the knowledge gained will need to be organized and presented in a way that the customer can use it. It often involves applying “live” models within an organization’s decision making processes—for example, real-time personalization of Web pages or repeated scoring of marketing databases. Depending on the requirements, the deployment phase can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing a repeatable data mining process across the enterprise. In many cases, it is the customer, not the data analyst, who carries out the deployment steps. However, even if the analyst will carry out the deployment effort, it is important for the customer to understand up front what actions need to be carried out in order to actually make use of the created models.</documentation>

        <documentation>1.1 Determine business objectives
Task Determine business objectives
The first objective of the data analyst is to thoroughly understand, from a business perspective, what the customer really wants to accomplish. Often the customer has many competing objectives and constraints that must be properly balanced. The analyst’s goal is to uncover important factors, at the beginning, that can influence the outcome of the project. A possible consequence of neglecting this step is to expend a great deal of effort producing the right answers to the wrong questions.

Outputs 
Background
Record the information that is known about the organization’s business situation at the beginning of the project.

Business objectives
Describe the customer’s primary objective, from a business perspective. In addition to the primary business objective, there are typically other related business questions that the customer would like to address. For example, the primary business goal might be to keep current customers by predicting when they are prone to move to a competitor. Examples of related business questions are “How does the primary channel used (e.g., ATM, branch visit, Internet) affect whether customers stay or go?” or “Will lower ATM fees significantly reduce the number of high-value customers who leave?”

Business success criteria
Describe the criteria for a successful or useful outcome to the project from the business point of view. This might be quite specific and able to be measured objectively, for example, reduction of customer churn to a certain level, or it might be general and subjective, such as “give useful insights into the relationships.” In the latter case, it should be indicated who makes the subjective judgment.</documentation>

49. The ability to connect/integrate different data sets in order to create a coherent set of information.

Description
50. Data integration is a key capability of the target architecture supporting our ability to fulfil information needs from different and existing sources.

51. It is supported by:
- Metadata-driven (schema-driven) data discovery within sources
- Data mash up and blending of heterogeneous sources (dataset, relational data bases, data  warehouses, Big Data, Linked Open Data) using different techniques
- Transformation/normalisation of data available in different format : e.g. a unstructured format (Mongo DB); structured (Relational Data Base)
- Access and connection to sources APIs independently from their location (local/remote/cloud environments)
- Agile acquisition/processing and delivery data workflows with automation / batch features
- Agile data modelling and structuring allowing users to specify data types and relationships
- Generation of semantic models and ontologies</documentation>

        <documentation>5.3. Review and validate

78. 	This sub-process examines data to try to identify potential problems, errors and discrepancies such as outliers, item non-response and miscoding. It can also be referred to as input data validation. It may be run iteratively, validating data against predefined edit rules, usually in a set order. It may flag data for automatic or manual inspection or editing. Reviewing and validating can apply to data from any type of source, before and after integration. Whilst validation is treated as part of the “Process” phase, in practice, some elements of validation may occur alongside collection activities, particularly for modes such as web collection. Whilst this sub-process is concerned with detection of actual or potential errors, any correction activities that actually change the data are done in sub-process 5.4.

• Networking: These are the resources that transfer data from one infrastructure framework component to another.
• Computing: These are the physical processors and memory that execute and hold the software of the other Big Data system components.
• Storage: These are resources which provide persistence of the data in a Big Data system.
• Physical Plant: These are the environmental resources (e.g., power, cooling, security) that must be accounted for when establishing an instance of a Big Data system.

While the Big Data Framework Provider component may be deployed directly on physical resources or on virtual resources, at some level all resources have a physical representation. Physical resources are frequently used to deploy multiple components that will be duplicated across a large number of physical nodes to provide what is known as horizontal scalability.

        <documentation>Data Platform Frameworks provide for the logical data organization and distribution combined with the associated access application programming interfaces (APIs) or methods. The frameworks may also include data registry and metadata services along with semantic data descriptions such as formal ontologies or taxonomies. The logical data organization may range from simple delimited flat files to fully distributed relational or columnar data stores. The storage mediums range from high latency robotic tape drives, to spinning magnetic media, to flash/solid state disks, or to random access memory. Accordingly, the access methods may range from file access APIs to query languages such as Structured Query Language (SQL). Typical Big Data framework implementations would support either basic file system style storage or in-memory storage and one or more indexed storage approaches. Based on the specific Big Data system considerations, this logical organization may or may not be distributed across a cluster of computing resources.

In most aspects, the logical data organization and distribution in Big Data storage frameworks mirrors the common approach for most legacy systems.  Figure 9 presents a brief overview of data organization approaches for Big Data.

Many Big Data logical storage organizations leverage the common file system concept where chunks of data are organized into a hierarchical namespace of directories as their base and then implement various indexing methods within the individual files. This allows many of these approaches to be run both on simple local storage file systems for testing purposes or on fully distributed file systems for scale.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:ApplicationFunction" name="Processing: Computing and Analytics" id="dd100ea2-2dbb-4460-94df-78401dcbbf4b">
        <documentation>The processing frameworks for Big Data provide the necessary infrastructure software to support implementation of applications that can deal with the volume, velocity, variety, and variability of data. Processing frameworks define how the computation and processing of the data is organized. Big Data applications rely on various platforms and technologies to meet the challenges of scalable data analytics and operation.

Processing frameworks generally focus on data manipulation, which falls along a continuum between batch and streaming oriented processing. However, depending on the specific data organization platform, and actual processing requested, any given framework may support a range of data manipulation from high latency to near real time (NRT) processing. Overall, many Big Data architectures will include multiple frameworks to support a wide range of requirements.

Typically, processing frameworks are categorized based on whether they support batch or streaming processing. This categorization is generally stated from the user perspective (e.g., how fast does a user get a response to a request). However, Big Data processing frameworks actually have three processing phases: data ingestion, data analysis, and data dissemination, which closely follow the flow of data through the architecture. The Big Data Application Provider activities control the application of specific framework capabilities to these processing phases. The batch-streaming continuum, illustrated in the processing subcomponent in the NBDRA (Figure 2), can be applied to the three distinct processing phases. For example, data may enter a Big Data system at high velocity and the end user must quickly retrieve a summary of the prior day’s data. In this case, the ingestion of the data into the system needs to be NRT and keep up with the data stream. The analysis portion could be incremental (e.g., performed as the data is ingested) or could be a batch process performed at a specified time, while retrieval (i.e., read visualization) of the data could be interactive. Specific to the use case, data transformation may take place at any point during its transit through the system. For example, the ingestion phase may only write the data as quickly as possible, or it may run some foundational analysis to track incrementally computed information such as minimum, maximum, average. The core processing job may only perform the analytic elements required by the Big Data Application Provider and compute a matrix of data or may actually generate some rendering like a heat map to support the visualization component. To permit rapid display, the data dissemination phase almost certainly does some rendering, but the extent depends on the nature of the data and the visualization.

For the purposes of this discussion, most processing frameworks can be described with respect to their primary location within the information flow illustrated in Figure 14.

The green coloring in Figure 14 illustrates the general sensitivity of that processing style to latency, which is defined as the time from when a request or piece of data arrives at a system until its processing/delivery is complete. The darker the shade, the more sensitive to latency. For Big Data, the ingestion may or may not require NRT performance to keep up with the data flow. Some types of analytics (specifically those categorized as Complex Event Processing) may or may not require NRT processing. The Data Consumer generally is located at the far right of Figure 14. Depending upon the use case and application batch responses (e.g., a nightly report is emailed) may be sufficient. In other cases, the user may be willing to wait minutes for the results of a query to be returned, or they may need immediate alerting when critical information arrives at the system. In general, batch analytics tend to better support long term strategic decision making, where the overall view or direction is not affected by the latest small changes in the underlying data. Streaming analytics are better suited for tactical decision making, where new data needs to be acted upon immediately. A primary use case for streaming analytics would be electronic trading on stock exchanges where the window to act on a given piece of data can be measured in microseconds. Messaging and communication provides the transfer of data between processing elements and the buffering necessary to deal with the deltas in data rate, processing times, and data requests.

Typically, Big Data discussions focus around the categories of batch and streaming frameworks for analytics. However, frameworks for retrieval of data that provide interactive access to Big Data are becoming a more prevalent. It is noted that the lines between these categories are not solid or distinct, with some frameworks providing aspects of each category.</documentation>

        <documentation>There is a difference between streaming data collection and batched data collection. Collecting the streaming data means that we have to have a failsafe infrastructure with backup functionality. When servers are down, no data is collected and there should be a backup server that takes over the collection. In case of batched data collection, the data is collected, for instance, every day. This kind of data collection does stress the infrastructure less. Please note, however, that making the collection periods longer the size of the data and the computational power for processing increases. We suggest to keep the batch size smaller than or equal to one day.

Furthermore, since the data is sensitive, it is imported into a save environment directly.

The received AIS messages from Dirkzwager are in NMEA format, which is a text encoded binary format (see the 6th field in Figure 2), which has to be decoded. The dataset was about 400 GB in size.

The messages are decoded using the Python AIS module. This library was already used in the Netherlands. However, the program crashed several times when decoding the European dataset. It took some time to figure out on which part of the dataset it actually crashed, since the error occurred 10 times on the in total 4.5 billion cases.

AIS consist of several types of records. We divided the messages into four file types. Some are about the position of the vessel (where the message id is 1, 2, 3 or 21), whereas others are about voyage related issues (where the message id is 5). The third was all other AIS messages we could decode, but the message type was not in the position report or voyage related. At this point we don’t see any information in this data, but perhaps in the future there will be some data we can use. The fourth is data we couldn’t decode. The records were written to different sets of files. One set concerned the position of the vessel and the others concerned the voyage of the vessel.

The set of files with positions of the vessel was the biggest. The position files have the following fields. The timestamps are technically not part of the VDM messages, but are transmitted as separate messages in the AIS stream.

After the data was decoded, all files were zipped to save space. The sets of files with positions and files with voyage related data were uploaded to the UNECE sandbox by a secure copy (scp). It took approximately 7 hours to copy the data.

Ships are linked between the two datasets (which were uploaded to the UNECE sandbox) by the Maritime Mobile Service Identity (mmsi) and approximately by the timestamp. The filenames are built up as follows: &lt;year>&lt;month>&lt;day>&lt;hour>&lt;minute>.csv.gz. The two datasets are distinguished by placing them in the folders Locations and Messages respectively. The locations data comprises 144 GB of compressed data (about 200 GB uncompressed) and the messages comprised about 5 GB of compressed data (about 7 GB uncompressed). After the data was decoded, it was uploaded to the UNECE sandbox by a secure copy (scp). It took approximately 7 hours to copy the data.

After uploading, the data was copied to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and available for use. Sometimes, the ssh-interface of the UNECE sandbox freezes. It is therefore advisable to use the screen-command, not only for uploading the data, but also for running a bigger job in Spark.

The port visit algorithm we have developed calculates the number of ships that have entered and departed a port. This algorithm calculates the time spend in the port and distance travelled within the port. It does this by:
- Processing the data from ships in the reference frame of ships with a median filter over 10 minutes for latitude, longitude and speed. Using this 10 minute window reduces the amount of data, enabling faster processing. It also takes care of the noise in the signal, rendering plausible positions and speeds even in cases where a ship is at anchor and transmits a signal only every 3 minutes. In that case, a shorter time interval would result in a single measurement that would not be corrected by other measurements (see also previous deliverable [1]). In other cases, a different temporal filter could be preferred, so we want to make this time interval variable in the algorithm.
- For each data point in this filtered selection the location is categorized as being at sea or in the port.
- Using (selected) MMSI, time and location category only, the port entries and departs are determined by selecting consecutive locations where category location changes. An entry being defined as a SEA-PORT couple and departure by a PORT-SEA couple. A successive entry and departure are coupled to form a visit interval, already resulting in the total visit time.
- If two visits are separated by one time interval (10 minutes in this case), the interval is coupled to form a longer visit interval.
- For the resulting visit interval, latitude, longitude and speed are combined again. Then, speed is used to define an actual visit/stop as some ships only travel through a port. For example in the port of Amsterdam the port area is also used for ships passing. Thus, only ships are selected that at some point have a speed of &lt;0.2 knots.
- Using the haversine function (which determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitude), distance travelled in port is calculated, see also PoC 4.1.</documentation>

The result of the previous analyses provides us with an output-driven method to define a journey. Using the departure of ships gives us the start of a journey. The end of the journey can be determined in three ways:
- The ship enters another port: a reference frame of ports has to be constructed to be able to categorize the ship as being at SEA or in a PORT. Again the successive couple SEA-PORT will signal the entry of the new port, constituting the end of the journey. The port visit method can be used to determine next destination, time of journey and distance covered during the journey.
- The ship anchors: if this is at sea, this journey will be continuing after this. Again, the port visit method can be used in this case.
- The ship leaves the area of AIS coverage. At this time, we have European coverage only. Therefore, we will have to use the boundaries of our data as end of a journey if a ship travels outside Europe. However, there are also areas of sea where satellite reception is minimal or ships can even turn off their AIS signal. If this is the case, we will use the next available information to linearly combine the data.</documentation>

        <documentation>See WP4, deliverable 4.2, paragraph 3

To build a reference frame, we initially linked all MMSI-IMO couples and filtered out couples with invalid IMO or MMSI numbers, purely based on length and for IMO the check digit (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMO_number).

IMO - String
An International Maritime Organization number is 7-digit unique number assigned to seagoing ships under the SOLAS regulation. It is assigned to the hull regardless of a name, flag or owner changes. The last digit is a check digit to validate the first 6 digits.

MMSI - integer
A Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) is a 9-digit unique number assigned to ships that have specific types of equipment such as AIS and (Very) High Frequency radio with Digital Selective Calling. This MMSI-number is sent in a digital form over a radio frequency channel to uniquely identify ship stations, ship earth stations, coast stations, coast earth stations and group calls.

Name - String
Name of a vessel

Callsign- String
Call sign of a vessel is a worldwide unique identifier for ships and boats assigned by their national licensing authorities Each call sign begins with the Call Sign alphanumeric prefix that indicates nationality. The prefix is usually followed by 2 or 3 alphanumeric characters.

Flag - String
2 Digit ISO 3166 Country Code of a vessel flag

Type - String
Type of a vessel

Still, AIS data does not provide sufficient information for a complete reference frame of maritime ships as maritime statistics require more specific information on the identity of vessels. For example, the type of vessel defined in AIS data is less detailed than required by maritime statistics based on Directive 2009/42/EC. (Note that there might be possibilities to infer these variables from AIS: e.g. inferring type of vessel from type of terminal visited). Another variable missing from AIS data is deadweight. Therefore, in order to get more detailed ship information, AIS data has to be linked to existing ship dictionaries, such as Lloyd's Register, Open data, or Web scraping methods.</documentation>

At the moment, defining ports for journeys or port visits in AIS is done manually. In other words, to build a reference frame of ports or terminals a bounding box or a combination of bounding boxes has to be defined as the region of interest. We have done this by visually inspecting Google Maps, selecting minimum and maximum latitude and a minimum and maximum longitude as the region of interest. As many countries have a lot of different ports, this constitutes a time costly job. Of course, when the analysis is even more detailed and zooms in on terminals, the number of regions of interest to be defined explodes. Besides the work on the initial reference frame of ports, this frame has to be kept up to date as the locations and functions of ports are dynamic. It is therefore desirable to use actual event data to define ports. Using AIS for this enables us to automate a lot of manual work, but it also facilitates keeping the register of ports up to date. In this PoC we investigated the possibilities of specifying ports data driven using AIS.
Before setting out to develop a port definition algorithm, we investigated what work in this field was already done. Interestingly, Marine Traffic already developed a data driven algorithm for defining the port of Rotterdam by means of AIS [4]. For this, they used a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE). KDE is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It is a fundamental data smoothing problem where inferences about the population are made, based on a finite data sample (see [5]). In our case, KDE can be used to infer the probability of a ship being at anchor at a specific location.
We conclude that this PoC has succeeded: it is possible to build a data driven algorithm for defining ports. In the near future, Statistics Netherlands and Marine traffic will collaborate on this and other issues. First, we would like to investigate building a reference frame of ports. Also, taking into account locations where ships anchor, but are not actual ports. Then, it would also be interesting to zoom in on defining the type of terminals. By assuming that type of ship reflects the type of terminal, type of ship will be taken into the model. Resulting in a reference frame of ports and terminals.

        <documentation>Until now we processed that AIS data in a SPARK environment. The data was stored in HDFS. The experience of Statistics Netherlands with road sensor data is that breaking down the data into small batch sizes makes it possible to do part of the processing on a normal infrastructure. For AIS data we can conclude that decoding the messages and encrypting the crucial fields can be done on a normal infrastructure. More complicated analysis, like determining routes and extracting visits, should be done on distributed environments like Spark. Storage of the data should be done on high performance big data file systems and databases are really needed to store the data.

Port authorities do not always have a complete insight in the activities within their port. For example, they do not always know whether ships visit one or multiple terminals during one visit, rendering a higher intra-port journey distance. Using AIS, these journeys in the port, and thus the intra-port distances can be derived. Intra-port travel distances is a new statistical product that could be generated by using AIS data. In this PoC we developed an algorithm to calculate these intra-port journeys.

The algorithm
Using the methodology developed for defining journeys (see Chapter 3), the point and time for a ship entering the port can be defined. Between the time of entering and departing the port, data points are selected. Then the data is median filtered over a 10-minute interval. This 10 minute interval renders sufficient valid measuring points in case a ship is at anchor and only transmits a signal every 3 minutes (see also deliverable 2, chapter 4). For each point and each successive point, the latitude and longitude are fed into the haversine function. The haversine function determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitude.</documentation>

Derive average distance matrix

In conclusion, distance estimation in time and space is viable for a small number of port pairs. For some port pairs with more than a few ships doing regular trips, some distance measures have very noisy distribution. Further work with subject matter experts is needed to decide exactly what kind of distance measure would be relevant for such pairs. In addition, future work is necessary for ships that are not in AIS covered area all the time.
When using AIS covering the whole world (in case of satellite data), AIS detected distances may even replace the distance matrix, as distances can be tracked for every journey of every ship. Perfect world coverage will probably not be accomplished in the near future, but we believe that strong algorithms can be developed to deal with these blind spots.

For drawing maps, several methods are available to project the earth on a map. One of them is the Lambert Azimuthal projection, which preserves the area.

Using this projection in Spark, and henceforth Scala, we implemented the projection (in the file named LAEA. Scala), together with the definition of the grid. For the grid, a bounding box was defined and subdivided in 200 by 200 grid points. Then, (in the file named countuniq.scala), the methods in the file LAEA.scala are used to project all latitudes and longitudes and find the index of the associated grid point. The latitude and longitude of that grid point is given back.

The final visualization is done in Shiny in combination with Leaflet. Shiny is a web application framework for R, with which one can create interactive web applications. Leaflet is a JavaScript library for interactive maps, which can also be used from R.</documentation>

In AIS-data, we can specify two types of errors Human errors and Technical errors. Human errors are related to static information (MMSI, IMO number, ship’s name, call sign, type, length) or voyage data (draught, destination). Since an AIS device is an autonomous device on board of the ship, these data are not obligatory to be added automatically. They are entered by change of values (voyage) or by installation of the AIS device (static). It is worth noting that voyage data must be manually updated after each port visit.

Technical errors are related to dynamic data (such as position of ship, speed, course, rotation) which comes from the AIS device (sensors, cables and antenna).

These errors are the result of transmission errors. These transmission errors can be between the GPS network and the device and between the device and the AIS receivers. 
These transmission errors can result in erroneous positions and identification of the vessels. Detailed information on the errors in AIS data can be found in WP4 deliverable 4.2.

        <documentation>Audit Framework components are responsible for collecting, managing, consolidating, and in some cases monitoring events from across the system that reflect access to and changes to data and services across the system. The scope and nature of the events collected is based on the requirements specified by the policies within the System Orchestrator. Typically, these components will collect and store this data within a secure centralized repository within the system and manage the retention of this data based on the policies. The data maintained by these components can be leveraged during system operation to provide providence and pedigree for data to users or application components as well as for forensic analysis in the response to security or data breaches. Because of the number and frequency of operations and events which may be generated by a large Big Data system, the framework itself must deal with the Big Data characteristics of volume and velocity. To handle this, many Big Data system architectures implement a Big Data system instance specifically for management and storage of this data. Monitoring frameworks within the Management Fabric may execute algorithms within this Big Data system instance to provide alerts to potential security or data issues.</documentation>

        <documentation>Components within this class must interface and interact with all other components within the Big Data system to support access control to the data and services of the system. This support includes authenticating the user or service attempting to access the system resource to validate their identity. This class of components provides APIs to other services and components for collecting the identity information, and validating that information against a trusted store of identities. Frequently these components will provide an identification token back to the invoking component that defines allowed access for the life of a session. This token can also be used to retrieve authorizations for the users/components detailing what data and service resources they may access. These authorizations can be used by the components to limit access to data or even filter data provided in response to requests by components. Typically, a component will pass the identification token as part of the request which the receiving component will use to look up authorizations from a trusted store to manage the access to the underlying resources (data or services).

Batch frameworks ideally are not tied to a particular algorithm or even algorithm type, but rather provide a programming model where multiple classes of algorithms can be implemented. Also, when discussed in terms of Big Data, these processing models are frequently distributed across multiple nodes of a cluster. They are routinely differentiated by the amount of data sharing between processes/activities within the model.</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:Node" name="Data Life Cycle Managers" id="e4fb1f40-5106-4e3f-8784-9c7d1fe684a1">
        <documentation>Life Cycle Data Management components are necessary to manage the life cycle of the data ingested into the system, stored and preserved in the system, and accessed for processing or dissemination purposes:

Metadata Catalog is the inventory of all datasets in the system. It should contain the model for the foundational concept of “unit” of data, whether it is a database record (e.g., key-value pair or relational table row), or a dataset (e.g., database export file). Each data unit has characteristics maintained in the associated metadata, which should include at least a unique identifier and timestamp indicating when the data was created and/or ingested. These timestamps will help the Data Life Cycle Manager to monitor the “age” of the data within the system. Moreover, the Metadata Catalog will have to support data discovery that is necessary for data access and data governance. There are numerous international and national standards which govern the content, model, and interfaces for metadata catalogs.

The Data Tracker tracks the movement of data throughout the system, from the ingestion point to the dissemination or destruction point. The Data Tracker component handles the Volume and Variety characteristics inherent to Big Data. The two kinds of movements are as follows:

• Ingress and egress movement: tracks data entering and exiting the system. Data exiting means that the data are dispositioned to satisfy the retention policy, which can originate from either the need of the Big Data application or preservation policy. Indeed, some applications may require “fresh” data for analytical purposes. The degree of freshness depends on the specific requirements of the business applications, and can be influenced by policy and regulations. For instance, while the visual analytics application monitoring the approval or disapproval feedback during a presidential election debate requires real-time data and most recent tweet and blog data, the study of the trend of household income over the past 50 years needs both recent and archived Census data. On the other hand, records management laws and policies may dictate the retention time for the data, and hence impact the Data Preservation.

• Intra-system movement: Due to the large volume of Big Data, the Big Data Framework Provider will likely have multitiered storage for cost-efficiency and scalability. Within that storage environment, data is made available to the analytics processes managed by the Big Data Application Provider. Commercial infrastructure vendors offer different storage categories with different pricing models. The action of making data available to processes and applications may be realized by physically moving the data to storage where the processing software can operate. However, a recent paradigm is to move computation and processing capabilities to where data are located to circumvent the large data transfer between storage tiers.

The Data Tracker may interface with the Data Preservation component to implement preservation and long-term storage policies.

The Data Preservation component is applied to both permanent and temporary data. Its responsibility is to continuously inspect the “age” of data in the system, and operate on the data based on the retention policy. For permanent data, Data Preservation will perform the Preservation Plan, which can consist of migrating data to a long-term preservation format, periodically refreshing the storage hardware, or maintaining emulation environments used to read the archived data. Data Preservation will leverage the multitiered storage which satisfies data durability requirement, and achieves cost-efficiency. If data are deemed to have limited lifetime, then Data Preservation will apply appropriate disposition methods to purge them from the system. The purge methods will depend on the security policy to ensure data confidentiality.</documentation>

        <documentation>Virtualization is frequently used to achieve elasticity and flexibility in the allocation of physical resources and is often referred to as infrastructure as a service (IaaS) within the cloud computing community. Virtualization is implemented via hypervisors that are typically found in one of three basic forms within a Big Data Architecture.
• Native: In this form, a hypervisor runs natively on the bare metal and manages multiple virtual machines consisting of operating systems (OS) and applications.
• Hosted: In this form, an OS runs natively on the bare metal and a hypervisor runs on top of that to host a client OS and applications. This model is not often seen in Big Data architectures due to the increased overhead of the extra OS layer.
• Containerized: In this form, hypervisor functions are embedded in the OS, which runs on bare metal. Applications are run inside containers, which control or limit access to the OS and physical machine resources. This approach has gained popularity for Big Data architectures because it further reduces overhead since most OS functions are a single shared resource. It may not be considered as secure or stable because in the event that the container controls/limits fail, one application may take down every application sharing those physical resources.</documentation>

        <documentation>Messaging and communications frameworks have their roots in the HPC environments long popular in the scientific and research communities. Messaging/Communications Frameworks were developed to provide APIs for the reliable queuing, transmission, and receipt of data between nodes in a horizontally scaled cluster. These frameworks typically implement either a point-to-point transfer model or a store- and-forward model in their architecture. Under a point-to-point model, data is transferred directly from the sender to the receivers. The majority of point-to-point implementations do not provide for any form of message recovery should there be a program crash or interruption in the communications link between sender and receiver. These frameworks typically implement all logic within the sender and receiver program space, including any delivery guarantees or message retransmission capabilities. One common variation of this model is the implementation of multicast (i.e., one-to-many or many-to-many distribution), which allows the sender to broadcast the messages over a channel, and receivers in turn listen to those channels of interest. Typically, multicast messaging does not implement any form of guaranteed receipt. With the store-and-forward model, the sender would address the message to one or more receivers and send it to an intermediate broker, which would store the message and then forward it on to the receivers. Many of these implementations support some form of persistence for messages not yet delivered, providing for recovery in the event of process or system failure. Multicast messaging can also be implemented in this model and is frequently referred to as a pub/sub model.</documentation>

        <documentation>To monitor the distributed and complex nature of the Big Data infrastructure, system management relies on the following:
• Standard protocols such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), which are used to transmit status about resources and fault information to the management fabric components; and
• Deployable agents or management connectors which allow the management fabric to both monitor and also control elements of the framework.

These two items aid in monitoring the health of various types of computing resources and coping with performance and failures incidents while maintaining the quality of service levels required by the Big Data Application Provider. Management connectors are necessary for scenarios where the cloud service providers expose management capabilities via APIs. It is conceivable that the infrastructure elements contain autonomic, self-tuning, and self-healing capabilities, thereby reducing the centralized model of system monitoring.</documentation>

        <documentation>Environmental resources, such as power and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning provided by physical plant components, are critical to the Big Data Framework Provider. While environmental resources are critical to the operation of the Big Data system, they are not within the technical boundaries and are, therefore, not depicted in Figure 2, the NBDRA conceptual model.

Adequately sized infrastructure to support application requirements is critical to the success of Big Data implementations. The infrastructure architecture operational requirements range from basic power and cooling to external bandwidth connectivity (as discussed above). A key evolution that has been driven by Big Data is the increase in server density (i.e., more CPU/memory/disk per rack unit). However, with this increased density, infrastructure—specifically power and cooling—may not be distributed within the data center to allow for sufficient power to each rack or adequate air flow to remove excess heat. In addition, with the high cost of managing energy consumption within data centers, technologies have been developed that actually power down or idle resources not in use to save energy or to reduce consumption during peak periods.

Also important within this element are the physical security of the facilities and auxiliary (e.g., power sub-stations). Specifically perimeter security to include credential verification (e.g., badge/biometrics), surveillance, and perimeter alarms all are necessary to maintain control of the data being processed.</documentation>

Computing infrastructure also frequently includes the underlying OSs and associated services used to interconnect the cluster resources via the networking elements. Computing resources may also include computation accelerators, such as Graphic Processing Units (GPU) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), which can provide dynamically programmed massively parallel computing capabilities to individual nodes in the infrastructure.</documentation>

        <documentation>The connectivity of the architecture infrastructure should be addressed, as it affects the velocity characteristic of Big Data. While some Big Data implementations may solely deal with data that is already resident in the data center and does not need to leave the confines of the local network, others may need to plan and account for the movement of Big Data either into or out of the data center. The location of Big Data systems with transfer requirements may depend on the availability of external network connectivity (i.e., bandwidth) and the limitations of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) where there is low latency (as measured by packet Round Trip Time) with the primary senders or receivers of Big Data. To address the limitations of TCP, architects for Big Data systems may need to consider some of the advanced non-TCP based communications protocols available that are specifically designed to transfer large files such as video and imagery.

Overall availability of the external links is another infrastructure aspect relating to the velocity characteristic of Big Data that should be considered in architecting external connectivity. A given connectivity link may be able to easily handle the velocity of data while operating correctly. However, should the quality of service on the link degrade or the link fail completely, data may be lost or simply back up to the point that it can never recover. Use cases exist where the contingency planning for network outages involves transferring data to physical media and physically transporting it to the desired destination. However, even this approach is limited by the time it may require to transfer the data to external media for transport.

The volume and velocity characteristics of Big Data often are driving factors in the implementation of the internal network infrastructure as well. For example, if the implementation requires frequent transfers of large multi-gigabyte files between cluster nodes, then high speed and low latency links are required to maintain connectivity to all nodes in the network. Provisions for dynamic quality of services (QoS) and service priority may be necessary in order to allow failed or disconnected nodes to re-synchronize once connectivity is restored. Depending on the availability requirements, redundant and fault tolerant links may be required. Other aspects of the network infrastructure include name resolution (e.g., Domain Name Server [DNS]) and encryption along with firewalls and other perimeter access control capabilities. Finally, the network infrastructure may also include automated deployment, provisioning capabilities, or agents and infrastructure wide monitoring agents that are leveraged by the management/communication elements to implement a specific model.

Security of the networks is another aspect that must be addressed depending on the sensitivity of the data being processed. Encryption may be needed between the network and external systems to avoid man in the middle interception and compromise of the data. In cases, where the network infrastructure within the data center is shared encryption of the local network should also be considered. Finally, in conjunction with the security and privacy fabric auditing and intrusion detection capabilities need to be addressed.

In large infrastructures with many thousands of computing and storage nodes, the provisioning of tools and applications should be as automated as possible. Software installation, application configuration, and regular patch maintenance should be pushed out and replicated across the nodes in an automated fashion, which could be done based on the topology knowledge of the infrastructure. With the advent of virtualization, the utilization of virtual images may speed up the recovery process and provide efficient patching that can minimize downtime for scheduled maintenance. Such frameworks also interact with the Security and Privacy Fabric to ensure that the system configuration continually meets the security requirements outlined in the policies specified by the System Orchestrator.</documentation>

        <documentation>As Big Data systems have evolved and become more complex, and as businesses work to leverage limited computation and storage resources to address a broader range of applications and business challenges, the requirement to effectively manage those resources has grown significantly. While tools for resource management and elastic computing have expanded and matured in response to the needs of cloud providers and virtualization technologies, Big Data introduces unique requirements for these tools. However, Big Data frameworks tend to fall more into a distributed computing paradigm, which presents additional challenges.

The Big Data characteristics of volume and velocity drive the requirements with respect to Big Data resource management. Elastic computing (i.e., spawning another instance of some service) is the most common approach to address expansion in volume or velocity of data entering the system. CPU and memory are the two resources that tend to be most essential to managing Big Data situations. While shortages or over-allocation of either will have significant impacts on system performance, improper or inefficient memory management is frequently catastrophic. Big Data differs and becomes more complex in the allocation of computing resources to different storage or processing frameworks that are optimized for specific applications and data structures. As such, resource management frameworks will often use data locality as one of the input variables in determining where new processing framework elements (e.g., master nodes, processing nodes, job slots) are instantiated. Importantly, because the data is big (i.e., large volume), it generally is not feasible to move data to the processing frameworks. In addition, while nearly all Big Data processing frameworks can be run in virtualized environments, most are designed to run on bare metal commodity hardware to provide efficient I/O for the volume of the data.

Two distinct approaches to resource management in Big Data frameworks are evolving. The first is intra- framework resource management, where the framework itself manages allocation of resources between its various components. This allocation is typically driven by the framework’s workload and often seeks to turn off unneeded resources to either minimize overall demands of the framework on the system or to minimize the operating cost of the system by reducing energy use. With this approach, applications can seek to schedule and request resources that—much like main frame OSs of the past—are managed through scheduling queues and job classes.

The second approach is inter-framework resource management, which is designed to address the needs of many Big Data systems to support multiple storage and processing frameworks that can address and be optimized for a wide range of applications. With this approach, the resource management framework actually runs as a service that supports and manages resource requests from frameworks, monitoring framework resource usage, and in some cases manages application queues. In many ways, this approach is like the resource management layers common in cloud/virtualization environments, and there are efforts underway to create hybrid resource management frameworks that handle both physical and virtual resources.

Taking these concepts further and combining them is resulting in the emerging technologies built around what is being termed software-defined data centers (SDDCs). This expansion on elastic and cloud computing goes beyond the management of fixed pools of physical resources as virtual resources to include the automated deployment and provisioning of features and capabilities onto physical resources. For example, automated deployment tools that interface with virtualization or other framework APIs can be used to automatically stand up entire clusters or to add additional physical resources to physical or virtual clusters.</documentation>

        <documentation>Resource management components within the Management Framework provide the system with the overall resources necessary to support the system. These components will work with external resource providers such as Cloud Service Providers to acquire the resources necessary to provision the other components of the system.

        <documentation>The storage infrastructure may include any resource from isolated local disks to storage area networks (SANs) or network-attached storage (NAS).

Two aspects of storage infrastructure technology that directly influence their suitability for Big Data solutions are capacity and transfer bandwidth. Capacity refers to the ability to handle the data volume. Local disks/file systems are specifically limited by the size of the available media. Hardware or software redundant array of independent disks (RAID) solutions—in this case local to a processing node—help with scaling by allowing multiple pieces of media to be treated as a single device. However, this approach is limited by the physical dimension of the media and the number of devices the node can accept. SAN and NAS implementations—often known as shared disk solutions—remove that limit by consolidating storage into a storage specific device. By consolidating storage, the second aspect—transfer bandwidth— may become an issue. While both network and I/O interfaces are getting faster and many implementations support multiple transfer channels, I/O bandwidth can still be a limiting factor. In addition, despite the redundancies provided by RAID, hot spares, multiple power supplies, and multiple controllers, these boxes can often become I/O bottlenecks or single points of failure in an enterprise. Many Big Data implementations address these issues by using distributed file systems within the platform framework.</documentation>

        <documentation>Streaming frameworks are built to deal with data that requires processing as fast or faster than the velocity at which it arrives into the Big Data system. The primary goal of streaming frameworks is to reduce the latency between the arrival of data into the system and the creation, storage, or presentation of the results. CEP is one of the problem domains frequently addressed by streaming frameworks. CEP uses data from one or more streams/sources to infer or identify events or patterns in NRT.

Almost all streaming frameworks for Big Data available today implement some form of basic workflow processing for the streams. These workflows use messaging/communications frameworks to pass data objects (often referred to as events) between steps in the workflow. This frequently takes the form of a directed execution graph. The distinguishing characteristics of streaming frameworks are typically organized around the following three characteristics: event ordering and processing guarantees, state management, and partitioning/parallelism.</documentation>

Organisational interoperability refers to the way in which public administrations align their business processes, responsibilities and expectations to achieve commonly agreed and mutually beneficial goals. In practice, organisational interoperability means documenting and integrating or aligning business processes and relevant information exchanged. Organisational interoperability also aims to meet the requirements of the user community by making services available, easily identifiable, accessible and user-focused.

Where possible, public administrations should seek to streamline and simplify their administrative processes by improving them or eliminating any that does not provide public value. Administrative simplification can help businesses and citizens to reduce the administrative burden of complying with EU legislation or national obligations. Likewise, public administrations should introduce European public services supported by electronic means, including their interactions with other public administrations, citizens and businesses.

Digitisation of public services should take place in accordance with the following concepts:
* digital-by-default, whenever appropriate, so that there is at least one digital channel available for accessing and using a given European public service;
* digital-first which means that priority is given to using public services via digital channels while applying the multi-channel delivery concept and the no-wrong-door policy, i.e. physical and digital channels co-exist.

        <documentation>EIF Underlying principle 7: inclusion and accessibility

Inclusion is about enabling everyone to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies to access and make use of European public services, overcoming social and economic divides and exclusion.
Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups can use public services at service levels comparable to those provided to other citizens.

Inclusion and accessibility must be part of the whole development lifecycle of a European public service in terms of design, information content and delivery. It should comply with e-accessibility specifications widely recognised at European or international level.

Inclusion and accessibility usually involve multi-channel delivery. Traditional paper-based or face-to-face service delivery may need to co-exist with electronic delivery.

Inclusion and accessibility can also be improved by an information system’s ability to allow third parties to act on behalf of citizens who are unable, either permanently or temporarily, to make direct use of public services.

        <documentation>EIF Underlying principle 9: multilingualism

European public services can potentially be used by anyone in any Member State. So multilingualism needs to be carefully considered when designing them. Citizens across Europe often have problems in accessing and using digital public services if these are not available in the languages they speak.

A balance needs to be found between the expectations of citizens and businesses to be served in their own language(s) or their preferred language(s) and the ability of Member States’ public administrations to offer services in all official EU languages. 
A suitable balance could be that European public services are available in the languages of the expected end-users, i.e. the number of languages is decided on the basis of users’ needs, such as the level to which the service is critical for the implementation of the digital single market or national policies, or the size of the relevant audience.

Multilingualism comes into play not just in the user interface, but at all levels in the design of European public services. For example, the choices made on data representation in an electronic database should not limit its ability to support different languages.

The multilingual aspect of interoperability becomes also relevant when a public service requires exchanges between information systems across language boundaries, as the meaning of the information exchanged must be preserved.

        <documentation>EIF Underlying principle 2: openness

In the context of interoperable public services, the concept of openness mainly relates to data, specifications and software.

Open government data (here simply referred ‘open data’) refers to the idea that all public data should be freely available for use and reuse by others, unless restrictions apply e.g. for protection of personal data, confidentiality, or intellectual property rights. Public administrations collect and generate huge amounts of data. The Directive on the reuse of public sector information (PSI)7 encourages Member States to make public information available for access and reuse as open data. The INSPIRE Directive8 requires, in addition, sharing of spatial datasets and services between public authorities with no restrictions or practical obstacles to its reuse. This data should be published with as few restrictions as possible and clear licences for its use to allow better scrutiny of administrations’ decision-making processes and realise transparency in practice.

The use of open source software technologies and products can help save development cost, avoid a lock-in effect and allow fast adaptation to specific business needs because the developer communities that support them are constantly adapting them. Public administrations should not only use open source software but whenever possible contribute to the pertinent developer communities. Open source is an enabler of the underlying EIF principle on reusability.

The level of openness of a specification/standard is decisive for the reuse of software components implementing that specification. This also applies when such components are used to introduce new European public services. If the openness principle applies in full:
* all stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the specification and a public review is part of the decision-making process;
* the specification is available for everyone to study;
* intellectual property rights to the specification are licensed on FRAND9 terms, in a way that allows implementation in both proprietary and open source software10, and preferably on a royalty-free basis.

Due to their positive effect on interoperability, the use of open specifications has been promoted in many policy statements and is encouraged for European public service delivery. The positive effect of open specifications is demonstrated by the internet ecosystem. However, public administrations may decide to use less open specifications if open ones do not exist or do not meet functional needs. In all cases, specifications should be mature and sufficiently supported by the market, unless they are being used to create innovative solutions.

Lastly, openness also means empowering citizens and businesses to get involved in the design of new services, to contribute to service improvement and to give feedback about the quality of the existing public services.

        <documentation>EIF Underlying principle 11: preservation of information

Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records18 and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.

To guarantee the long-term preservation of electronic records and other kinds of information, formats should be chosen to ensure long-term accessibility, including preservation of associated electronic signatures or seals. In this regard, the use of qualified preservation services, in line with Regulation (EU) 910/2014, can ensure the long-term preservation of information.

For information sources owned and managed by national administrations, preservation is a purely national matter. For information that is not strictly national, preservation becomes a European issue. In that case, an appropriate ‘preservation policy’ should be applied by the Member States concerned, to cope with any difficulties arising if the relevant information is used under different jurisdictions.

        <documentation>EIF Underlying principle 4: reusability

Reuse means that public administrations confronted with a specific problem seek to benefit from the work of others by looking at what is available, assessing its usefulness or relevance to the problem at hand, and where appropriate, adopting solutions that have proven their value elsewhere. This requires the public administration to be open to sharing its interoperability solutions, concepts, frameworks, specifications, tools and components with others.

Reusability of IT solutions (e.g. software components, Application Programming Interfaces, standards), information and data, is an enabler of interoperability and improves quality because it extends operational use, as well as saving money and time. This makes it a major contributor to the development of a digital single market in the EU. Some EU standards and specifications also exist in the DIFs and should be applied more widely. For example, the INSPIRE Directive sets out interoperability standards for addresses, cadastres, roads and many other data topics of relevance to many public administrations. These existing standards and specifications can and should be used more widely beyond the domain for which they were originally developed.

Several public administrations and governments across the EU already promote sharing and reuse of IT solutions by adopting new business models, promoting the use of open source software for key ICT services and when deploying digital service infrastructure.

There are some key challenges that limit the sharing and reuse of IT solutions, at technical, organisational, legal and communication levels. The ISA² sharing and reuse framework for IT solutions12 provides recommendations for public administrations to help them overcome these challenges and share/reuse common IT solutions. Reuse and sharing can be effectively supported by collaborative platforms.

The subsidiarity principle requires EU decisions to be taken as closely as possible to the citizen. In other words, the EU does not take action unless this is more effective than the same action taken at national level. The proportionality principle limits EU actions to what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties.

Concerning interoperability, a European framework is justified to overcome differences in policies that result in heterogeneity and lack of interoperability and that put at risk the digital single market.

The EIF is envisaged as the ‘common denominator’ of interoperability policies in Member States. Member States should enjoy sufficient freedom to develop their NIFs with respect to EIF recommendations. NIFs are expected to be tailored and extended in such a way that national specificities are properly addressed.

        <documentation>EIF Underlying principle 5: technological neutrality and data portability

When establishing European public services, public administrations should focus on functional needs and defer decisions on technology as long as possible in order to minimise technological dependencies, to avoid imposing specific technical implementations or products on their constituents and to be able to adapt to the rapidly evolving technological environment.

Public administrations should provide for access and reuse of their public services and data irrespective of specific technologies or products.

The functioning of the digital single market requires data to be easily transferable among different systems to avoid lock-in, support the free movement of data. This requirement relates to data portability - the ability to move and reuse data easily among different applications and systems, which becomes even more challenging in cross-border scenarios.

        <documentation>EIF Underlying principle 3: transparency

Transparency in the EIF context refers to:
1. Enabling visibility inside the administrative environment of a public administration. This is about allowing other public administrations, citizens and businesses to view and understand administrative rules, processes11, data, services and decision-making.
2. Ensuring availability of interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems.
3. Securing the right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations.

        <documentation>EIF Underlying principle 6: user-centricity

Users of European public services are meant to be any public administration, citizen or businesses accessing and benefiting from the use of these services. Users’ needs should be considered when determining which public services should be provided and how they should be delivered.
Therefore, as far as possible, user needs and requirements should guide the design and development of public services, in accordance with the following expectations:
* A multi-channel service delivery approach, meaning the availability of alternative channels, physical and digital, to access a service, is an important part of public service design, as users may prefer different channels depending on the circumstances and their needs;
* A single point of contact should be made available to users, to hide internal administrative complexity and facilitate access to public services, e.g. when multiple bodies have to work together to provide a public service;
* Users’ feedback should be systematically collected, assessed and used to design new public services and to further improve existing ones;
* As far as possible, under the legislation in force, users should be able to provide data once only, and administrations should be able to retrieve and share this data to serve the user, in accordance with data protection rules;
* Users should be asked to provide only the information that is absolutely necessary to obtain a given public service.

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 29 January 2014
68/261. Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics
The General Assembly,
Recalling recent resolutions of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council highlighting the fundamental importance of official statistics for the national and global development agenda,
Bearing in mind the critical role of high-quality official statistical information in analysis and informed policy decision-making in support of sustainable development, peace and security, as well as for mutual knowledge and trade among the States and peoples of an increasingly connected world, demanding openness and transparency,
Bearing in mind also that the essential trust of the public in the integrity of official statistical systems and confidence in statistics depend to a large extent on respect for the fundamental values and principles that are the basis of any society seeking to understand itself and respect the rights of its members, and in this context that professional independence and accountability of statistical agencies are crucial,
Stressing that, in order to be effective, the fundamental values and principles that govern statistical work have to be guaranteed by legal and institutional frameworks and be respected at all political levels and by all stakeholders in national statistical systems,
Endorses the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics set out below, as adopted by the Statistical Commission in 1994 and reaffirmed in 2013, and endorsed by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 2013/21 of 24 July 2013:

Principle 1. Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the Government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens’ entitlement to public information.
Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data.
Principle 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics.
Principle 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics.
Principle 5. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents.
Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes.
Principle 7. The laws, regulations and measures under which the statistical systems operate are to be made public.
Principle 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system.
Principle 9. The use by statistical agencies in each country of international concepts, classifications and methods promotes the consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels.
Principle 10. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries.</documentation>

        <documentation>1. Information is managed as an asset throughout its lifecycle

Statement
Information includes both the data and the metadata describing that data;
Information includes all objects that describe the context, content, controls and structure of data and metadata;
Information is an organisational asset that all employees have a responsibility to manage;
Information must be actively managed throughout its lifecycle from creation to disposal;
The ownership, status, quality and security classification of information should be known at all times.

Rationale
The statistical organisation has a responsibility to manage the data and metadata it acquires in accordance with relevant legalisation;
Managing the information is necessary to guarantee constant quality of statistical products;
Information needs to be managed to ensure its context and integrity is maintained over time;
As information is increasingly shared across business processes it is important to understand the dependencies of its use.

Implications
The statistical organisation will take an enterprise approach to managing information as an asset;
Organisational policies and guidelines will be put in place to ensure data will be managed in accordance with this principle;
All data assets will have an owner responsible for their management;
Staff will be trained to understand the value of data and their individual responsibilities;
Data quality and sensitivity will be documented where required for business processes;
Data will be protected against loss;
Data and metadata must not be kept longer than necessary in order to protect privacy; it should be deleted at the end of its lifecycle.</documentation>

Statement
Key information should be described using common, business-oriented, models and standards, agreed by the organisation.

Rationale
Having agreed models and standards will enable greater information sharing and reuse across the business process;
Having agreed models and standards will enable staff to communicate using a common language.

Implications
There will be responsibility assigned for creating and maintaining agreed models and standards;
Staff will be made aware of what the approved models and standards are and how to use them;
Agreed models and standards will enable external collaboration but also be fit for business purposes;
Agreed models and standards will form the basis of system and process design, deviations from the standards and models will be by agreed exception only.</documentation>

Statement
Within a business process, there should be an authoritative source from which information should be sourced and updated;
Where practical, existing information should be reused instead of recreated or duplicated.

Rationale
Maintaining fewer sources of information is more cost effective;
Having one source of information supports discovery, reuse and a ‘single version of truth’.

Implications
There will be authoritative repositories for different types of information;
Information needs will be satisfied using existing sources where possible.</documentation>

        <documentation>Projects build on solid cost-benefit analysis

Statement
Projects build on solid cost-benefit analysis, to identify the most viable project scenario and anticipate cost and benefits across the ESS and over time. Any such analysis should thus cover cost &amp; benefits accruing at the European as well as at the national Level.
In the project’s design phase, the total cost of ownership of the project (showing investment cost and operating expenditures distributed over the lifetime of the project) are to be estimated compared to its benefits. This analysis indicates which project implementation scenario will yield the most adequate project results. Each project should present at a minimum 2 possible implementation scenarios.
During the implementation phase, investments and operational expenditures are to be tracked compared to the accruing benefits, in accordance with the initial business case. The tracking can be done at pre-defined points in time (so-called gateway points), at which the project may be altered depending on the analysis’ results.

Rationale
By systematically implementing business case and cost tracking methods, projects and project scenarios become comparable
Investment/disinvestment choices are objectivized
It becomes visible at what Level (European, national) cost &amp; benefits accrue, and at what point in time
Cost are anticipated
Cost are controlled
National and European investments can be planned ahead, respecting individual investment cycles

Implications
There needs to be a standard, solid method for business case analysis and TCO 
There needs to be a data base into which projects report
The implications of the analysis on financing and governance need to be made explicit</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Continuous delivery outputs" id="3648e9f9-3d6e-4a68-9443-ca763ca74df7">
        <documentation>Projects are designed to continuously deliver outputs &amp; outcomes

Statement
Projects are designed to continuously deliver, i.e. release intermediate deliverables on their path to the final deliverable. This in practice implies that projects spanning across multiple planning periods are split into smaller sub-projects, each of them leading to a tangible and, where relevant, operational sub-deliverable. For this purpose, techniques such as automated testing, continuous integration and continuous deployment can be used, resulting in the ability to more rapidly, reliably and repeatedly push out deliverables, whilst at the same time lowering project risk.

Rationale
Ensures that every change is releasable
Makes it easier to take into account interdependencies with other project’s deliverables
Makes visible project risks and sources for failure faster
The demonstration of success across the project’s life cycle maintains motivation &amp; momentum around the project

Implications
This requires a change in mind-set compared to project stakeholders being used to long cycle times and the sole release of final outputs
This also requires a change in mind-set on the side of project evaluators who need to be prepared to evaluate unfinished output and quickly steer improvements</documentation>

        <documentation>Projects deliver re-usable capabilities

Statement
Projects that deliver capabilities must ensure that the benefits of their effort are maximized. One way of achieving this is to ensure that the delivered capabilities can be used for as many different purposes as realistic within the context of the project. For each project, multiple potential users must be identified and their requirements taken into consideration when proposing an ESS project.

Rationale
Having more users identified guarantees multiple users and hence reuse
Deliverables are reusable
Creates reusable capabilities, potentially even across statistical subject matter domains
User needs &amp; requirements are determined and responded to in the earliest stages of a project

Implications
Need to identify multiple users for suggested project deliverable
Need to collect requirements from those users
Need to consolidate requirements into one coherent set of requirements
Need to design for delivering to multiple users/environments; solution must be adaptable to these different circumstances</documentation>

The project’s business case should clearly state what the intended lifecycle is (see next Principle). Generic capabilities that are used in multiple processes for producing diverse products in general have longer lifecycles. The longer the lifecycle, the more there is a need for adaptability such that the capability can be changed to meet future needs.

Rationale
Capabilities are the fabric of the statistical organization
Investments need good ROI
ROI is typically better if benefits can be reaped over a longer period

Implications
Project proposals with short term views should be scrutinized before approval
By necessity, capabilities must be adaptable to changing circumstances and requirements</documentation>

        <documentation>Projects deliver products that are useful to users

Statement
Statistical output is useful if the information describes relevant topics, i.e. if it is understandable, unambiguous and if the data is sufficiently accurate and timely. We further consider coherency between topics, consistency over time and comparability between regions and countries as different aspects of usefulness.

Rationale
Delivering products that do not fulfill a user need constitutes waste and should be avoided
Statistical output only delivers value if it is used
No positive business case is possible unless user value is generated
ESS Vision 2020 recognizes different end user groups with different needs. However, given limited resources, the needs of users that together generate the most value should be prioritized

Implications
Information needs of end users must be known
Products must be designed to fulfill an identified need
Products must have adequate (enough, but not more) quality in terms of detail, reliability and precision
Products must be designed to be unambiguous and understandable
Products must be produced and delivered on time
Products must be delivered in a suitable form (presentation-wise, technology-wise)</documentation>

        <documentation>Projects keep in mind and embed security requirements as of the design phase

Statement
Security is a critical factor within (IT) projects and therefore it is crucial that it is included in the design phase. Building in security requirements at a later stage may compromise the effectiveness and the compatibility of the chosen security solution.

Rationale
Security is a complex domain and should therefore be integrated as of the beginning
Projects that do not address the security aspect (timely) are exposed to greater risk
with respect to data confidentiality, integrity and availability
Information is the key asset of official statistics. Information cannot be compromised by external and internal stakeholders or by unauthorized external parties
The sharing of confidential information requires that the flows of information are secured and access and usage is traceable

Implications
Security requirements need to be known and defined in the design phase
Security requirements need to be aligned with and mapped to the business requirements
A security risk assessment must be conducted</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Existing standards are used" id="75e921b7-af36-464a-a5e5-f8a61f060ba5">
        <documentation>Existing standards are used where applicable

Statement
Standards can be formal or de facto in nature and ensure interoperability between products and solutions.
To reach interoperability in the context of pan-European eGovernment services, guidance needs to focus on open standards (in line with the “European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services”) and existing standards in general. Use of standards is important in order to understand capabilities, and to be able to re-use services, in a consistent and comparable way.
Services that are made available based on standards will increase the value for stakeholders, and add value to consumers. When designing capabilities and services, existing standards thus need to be identified and evaluated.

Rationale
Making use of existing standards is necessary for building sustainable capabilities
Using standards increases the possibility of collaboration
Making use of standards enables the project to focus on delivering the core business functionality
Supports interoperability

Implications
The knowledge of applicable standards needs to be high
Methods for evaluating standards is a pre-requisite for projects
Whether or not to use a standard is a decision point for the project
Evaluations of standards should be made publicly available for the statistical community
A commitment of intent to adopt Open standards</documentation>

        <documentation>Communication with externals is adaptive and flexible

Statement
Capabilities for dissemination should be built using the most appropriate communication channels as a way of ensuring adaptability to new user needs and technology developments.
The same applies to capabilities for communicating with data providers. As new technologies and data sources emerge, capabilities for data collection must be able to adapt to handling data collection in new ways.

Rationale
Capability sustainability
Development of technologies for communication is accelerating
Ensuring that the integration of new data sources for statistics and lowering the respondent burden are high priority

Implications
The design of a capability for dissemination or collection will have to separate the core capability functionality from the functionality for communicating with external members
Capabilities for communication must be able to handle varying mechanisms of communication such as push/pull and batch/stream
Both formal and less formal communication standards can be used, but the decision has to be based on an identification and evaluation of available standards</documentation>

        <documentation>Information is available for reuse

Statement
Information is an important asset for statistical institutions. Information should be available for reuse for both internal and external users, as well as ensuring that only one single authoritative source exists.

Rationale
This Principle is based on the need for better retrieval, and the possibility of increased reuse of information
Better policy management/control regarding secure access to data
Reduced response burden when reusing data across statistical subject matter domains
Opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies

Implications
Data need to be uniquely identifiable across systems
Well defined metadata must be available
Well documented information models of the data based on standards should be available
Standardized interfaces to identify and retrieve data should be available
Governance of master data and metadata need to be established
For efficient reuse of information, one should avoid manual processing
Capabilities for exchanging information have to be available or have to be built for effective collaboration</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Information throughput need-based" id="c0a61f42-f925-4ca4-a745-348079b1cc9e">
        <documentation>Information throughput is needs-based

Statement
Statistics should serve the needs of the stakeholders. Speaking in terms of the statistical production value chain, information is delivered as a product (output) at the end of the value chain. In the earlier planning and design phases of statistics, one would “Identify needs”, “Consult and Confirm needs”, and “Design outputs”. These different throughput phases in the production of statistics have different needs for information; both in terms of data and metadata.

Rationale
By focusing on information needs across the statistical value chain we avoid collecting, analyzing and processing information that is not used or needed
The respondent burden is lessened by avoiding collecting unnecessary data
Consistent information models and linkage description between processes
The information flow in a statistical production process should reflect the statistical output
The information should be of sufficient (but not necessarily higher) quality to meet the purpose of intended use

Implications
A deep knowledge of information requirements is a pre-requisite
Understanding of the process steps in producing statistics and the information needs in each process step
An understanding of the quality characteristics of information is essential to ensure the information’s appropriate use
Information is documented, both data and metadata

        <documentation>Innovation is a focus area

Statement
Besides running the day-to-day business, statistical organizations must adapt to changing circumstances. Projects considered under the ESS should have a clear focus on innovation. Innovation is necessary and must get sufficient attention and funding. Resources must be made available to design new products, methods and processes.

Rationale
Innovation is the only way to change.
Change is needed in order to stay relevant in a fast-evolving environment.

Implications
Always consider what the innovative element is in the proposed project.
Innovative solutions are (in essence) to be favored over conservative ones.
Separate funding for innovation activities that might not deliver expected results (but will deliver knowledge, learning) must be ensured
Measures must be taken to limit the risk of potential failures. There is a risk that (few) successes will emerge compared to (many) outcomes that &quot;only&quot; deliver knowledge and learning</documentation>

        <documentation>New standards are developed where necessary

Statement
Standards are useful as agreements between parties that have decided to collaborate. Existing standards should be used wherever applicable. Where existing standards do not exist or prove to be insufficient, new standards should be developed and agreed upon.

Rationale
Standards are important prerequisites for efficient data exchange, reuse, collaboration, and interoperability
Standards are only needed if they are helpful, standards are means and should not become goals in themselves
No standards should be developed and agreed unless such a standard brings clear benefits to the community as a whole

        <documentation>Processes and systems are configurable

Statement
Processes and supporting systems are configurable. The execution of the process can be easily adapted to a changing context (i.e. varying quality requirement, other data sources, ...).

Rationale
Production process will be rendered more flexible and can quickly adapt to new, emerging needs
Quality audit and improvements will be enabled through the analysis of process behavior and history
Cost of adaptation are significantly reduced
The possibility of effective reuse of processes and systems will significantly increase

Implications
The metadata structure are entirely specified in the design phase
Ensure that metadata are active at the design phase of production systems (active metadata are metadata that drive other processes and actions)
Process metadata can be managed (i.e. stored, edited, retrieved)
Process descriptions and metadata structures follow industry standards</documentation>

      <element xsi:type="archimate:Principle" name="Processes are automated" id="35e226e6-5ab5-4519-afaa-c82fe93a3767">
        <documentation>Processes are automated

Statement
Repetitive and multi-users processes are automated wherever possible. Manual interventions (especially for low value add tasks) are reduced to a minimum.

Rationale
Process automation reduces the risk of human processing errors in low value operations such as information acquisition and therefore contributes to increasing the quality of the statistical output
Automation significantly reduces processing time and human resource consumption allowing a refocusing of resources on higher value tasks

Implications
Information systems are fully configurable and auditable (possibility to trace and reproduce processes)
Information architecture (information and process models and standards) enables machine to machine communication
Quality control is built in in the system and quality reports and warnings are generated automatically and made available to the process owner (through e.g. a process dash boards)</documentation>

        <documentation>Quality control is built in

Statement
Information systems and statistical services generate the metadata required to track, monitor and continuously improve the quality of statistical outputs, statistical processes and the characteristics of the institutional environment in which the statistics are being produced.
They make use of (where relevant reusable, else specific) capabilities to support preventive or corrective actions and ensure compliance with quality requirements as early in the statistical production chain as possible.

Rationale
Support realizing the ambition of Vision 2020 stating that “We manifest ourselves as the statistical conscience, which guides society through the information overload&quot;.

Metadata Management is an integral part of Quality management.
Statistical processing services are integral parts of Quality management.  Quality management capabilities are developed from an ESS perspective.</documentation>

        <documentation>Reuse before adapt before buy before build

Statement
The first, preferred option to cover an identified need should be to reuse an existing generic component (methods, definition, package/module/component/service ...). If such functionalities are not readily available, the second option is to adapt a solution which already exists ideally in an OSS framework. If not appropriate, the third option is to buy an existing package (Common-off-the-shelf, abbreviated as COTS). Only when no such packages are available, the functionalities should be built.

Rationale
Reusing components minimizes development time and cost
Existing solutions which have already been tested in production are likely to be more robust and deliver to quality requirements

Implications
The business case systematically evaluates the different relevant alternatives
There is a need for a well governed catalogue describing, certifying and pointing to the reusable components
This Principle need to be balanced with the need to innovate and the need for sustainability. This type of choice requires a cost benefit analysis with a TCO perspective</documentation>

        <documentation>Scalability is an important consideration

Statement
Future needs of scalability are an important consideration when designing the context in which the capability will be embedded. Scalability considerations involve ensuring that the capability is able to handle a foreseeable expansion of the business scope and an increased number of active concurrent users. If scalability is not considered at the outset, there is a risk of a higher TCO as the business scope expands.

Rationale
Making sure a capability is scalable is an important factor for creating sustainable business processes
The lack of consideration of scalability in an early phase could have a significant negative impact when scalability becomes an issue

Implications
To decide on the correct Level of scalability it is required that the project understands the intended scope of usage
The project is required to have a strategic approach and take into consideration future usage of the capability</documentation>

        <documentation>Security is built in

Statement
Information assets and systems are guaranteed to be available, cannot be compromised and their access is controlled implementing the following dimensions of security: Availability, Integrity, Non-Repudiation and Confidentiality.

Rationale
Implementation of security is imposed in different legal provisions requesting different Levels of confidentiality
Information is the key asset of official statistics. Information cannot be compromised by external and internal stakeholders
We should maintain trust from our information providers. Ensuring security of data along their entire life cycle is the corner stone for building trust among ESS members
The sharing of confidential information requires that the flows of information are secured and access and usage is traceable
External risk (attacks) are increasing

Implications
ESS wide security architecture is developed and implemented
Systems are made security compliant with the adopted norms from the design stage on
Access to confidential information is appropriately restricted and monitored
Data ownership and data agents roles are clearly defined
Computing systems are able to cope with distributed resources and implementation</documentation>

        <documentation>Projects use an adaptive project management approach

Statement
Projects build iterative evaluation cycles into their project management approach, whereby evaluations can lead to changes in the course of the project (adaptations). Evaluations typically occur when interim deliverables are due. The deliverables can then be considered as stages to the project.
Projects that develop in iterations constantly gather feedback to help refine their requirements. The end result is that the deliverables better meet (internal and/or external) user needs and are produced with minimal costs, within minimal time. Iterations are planned in systematically, usually rather rapid (every x weeks) and fixed in resources. Depending on the change requirement resulting from the evaluation, the most appropriate governing body is consulted on the feasibility and relevance of the adaptation to realize.

Rationale
Projects can adapt (and save cost) as they get modified to fit changes to reality
Incremental and iterative project planning typically better suits evolving contexts or
contexts that are defined at a high, visionary Level at their outset. In such cases, projects evolve through ongoing discovery.

Implications
This requires that the right leaders and a strong program team are in place.  Project executives must be involved more strongly &amp; continuously.
Project executives need to make faster decisions.</documentation>

Explanation
Data collection instruments should - when possible - reuse or build on existing and proven Data Collection instruments, including surveys, administrative data sources and other.

Rationale
The cost of building new collection instruments and therefore designing new statistics is reduced. The quality of data collection instruments is improved through the systematic re-use.

The GSBPM describes and defines the set of business processes needed to produce official statistics. It provides a standard framework and harmonised terminology to help statistical organisations to modernise their statistical production processes, as well as to share methods and components. The GSBPM can also be used for integrating data and metadata standards, as a template for process documentation, for harmonizing statistical computing infrastructures, and to provide a framework for process quality assessment and improvement.</content>

CSPA is a reference architecture for the statistical industry.  The scope of CSPA is statistical production across the processes defined by the GSBPM (i.e. it does not characterize a full enterprise architecture for a statistical organization). It is understood that statistical organizations may also have a more general Enterprise Architecture (for example an Enterprise Architecture used by all government agencies in a particular country).</content>

- show how the building blocks fit together
- contain a set of tools
- provide a common vocabulary
- include a list of recommended standards
- include a list of compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks</content>
